In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spreading and increasing worldwide. There is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; therefore, the objective of this paper is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against 2019-nCoV using immunoinformatics approach. Method: We will highlight a technique facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach with comparative genomic approach to determine our potential target for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in 2019-nCoV strain; in addition, 10 MHC1 and MHC2 related peptides were promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99% respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for 2019-nCoV using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine rapidly needs to validates clinically to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to assist on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adiga, Aniruddha</author><author>Venkatramanan, Srinivasan</author><author>Peddireddy, Akhil</author><author>Telionis, Alex</author><author>Dickerman, Allan</author><author>Wilson, Amanda</author><author>Bura, Andrei</author><author>Warren, Andrew</author><author>Vullikanti, Anil</author><author>Klahn, Brian D</author><author>Mao, Chunhong</author><author>Xie, Dawen</author><author>Machi, Dustin</author><author>Raymond, Erin</author><author>Meng, Fanchao</author><author>Barrow, Golda</author><author>Baek, Hannah</author><author>Mortveit, Henning</author><author>Schlitt, James</author><author>Chen, Jiangzhuo</author><author>Walke, Jim</author><author>Goldstein, Joshua</author><author>Orr, Mark</author><author>Porebski, Przemyslaw</author><author>Beckman, Richard</author><author>Kenyon, Ron</author><author>Swarup, Samarth</author><author>Hoops, Stefan</author><author>Eubank, Stephen</author><author>Lewis, Bryan</author><author>Marathe, Madhav</author><author>Barrett, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025882</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025882</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to predict COVID-19 times of arrival (ToA) for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we provide estimated ToA for all other countries. By combining effective distance with a measure for the country's vulnerability (Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI)), we propose a metric to rank vulnerable countries at immediate risk of case emergence. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries.

There is an imminent need to better understand this new virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 9 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ai, Jing-Wen</author><author>Zhang, Hao-Cheng</author><author>Xu, Teng</author><author>Wu, Jing</author><author>Zhu, Mengqi</author><author>Yu, Yi-Qi</author><author>Zhang, Han-Yue</author><author>Shen, Zhongliang</author><author>Li, Yang</author><author>Zhou, Xian</author><author>Zang, Guo-Qing</author><author>Xu, Jie</author><author>Chen, Wen-Jing</author><author>Li, Yong-Jun</author><author>Xie, De-Sheng</author><author>Zhou, Ming-Zhe</author><author>Sun, Jing-Ying</author><author>Chen, Jia-Zhen</author><author>Zhang, Wen-Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimizing diagnostic strategy for novel coronavirus pneumonia, a multi-center study in Eastern China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022673</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022673</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>COVID-19 caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province since December 2019, and caused a rapid outbreak throughout China and globally. Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe appreciated the support by National Key R&amp;amp;D Program of China (Grant No: 2018YFA0606200).

Methods: We used a comparative pangenomic analysis of Betacoronavirus sequenced thus far to detect the core and accessory gene clusters of this genus including SARS-CoV-2. We then annotate the functions, which are confirmed by structural analysis, and predict the potential location within the host cells of these proteins. Findings: We found five accessory gene clusters common to the SARS clade, including SARS-CoV-2, that perform functions supporting their pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analysis showed one of the accessory gene clusters, the protein E, to be present across the inferred evolutionary pathway of the SARS clade, including that of the horseshoe bat virus (Hp-betacoronavirus/Zhejiang2013), inferred to be the parental member of the clade. The E protein is highly conserved in the clade, differing between SARS and SARS-Cov2 with a difference of single amino acid substitution and a single amino acid insertion present in SARS but absent from SARS-CoV-2.

Interpretation: The characterization and functional assessment of SARS-CoV-2 envelope, E, protein in gene cluster 6, together with previous findings on this protein for SARS, leads us to recommend that detection of COVID-2019 be developed based on the SARS-CoV-2 E protein and that treatment using mutated SARS-Cov-2 lacking the E protein be explored as a promising candidate for a vaccine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Web Page">16</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Althaus, CL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating case fatality ratio of COVID-19 from observed cases outside China</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><web-urls><url>https://github.com/calthaus/ncov-cfr/blob/master/README.md</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>An, Ping</author><author>Chen, Hongbin</author><author>Jiang, Xiaoda</author><author>Su, Juan</author><author>Yijuan, Yong Xiao</author><author>Haixia, Ding</author><author>Mengyao, Ren</author><author>Chen, Ji Yifei</author><author>Chen, Wei</author><author>Lv, Xiaoguang</author><author>Shen, Lei</author><author>Chen, Mingkai</author><author>Li, Jiao</author><author>Yin, Anning</author><author>Kang, Jian</author><author>Liu, Shuzhong</author><author>Tan, Wei</author><author>Wu, Lianlian</author><author>Dong, Weiguo</author><author>Cao, Jiwang</author><author>Zhou, Zhongyin</author><author>Tan, Shiyun</author><author>Chen, Guozhong</author><author>Zhou, Jing</author><author>Yang, Yanning</author><author>Yu, Honggang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia presented gastrointestinal symptoms but without fever onset</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3532530</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anastassopoulou, Cleo</author><author>Russo, Lucia</author><author>Tsakris, Athanasios</author><author>Siettos, Constantinos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20022186</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Since the first suspected case of novel coronavirus (2019 nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) on December 1st, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in China up to February 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) for Hubei from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, we have repeated the calculations under a scenario that considers five times the number of confirmed infected cases and eight times the number of recovered. Our computations and analysis were based on a mean field Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be 2.5, while the one computed by the official counts of the confirmed cases from the 11th of January until the 18th of January was found to be 4.6. Furthermore, on the estimated parameters from both scenarios, we provide tentative three-week forecasts of the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the cumulative number of infected will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of current data and estimations on the official count of infected people in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by February 29; however, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but also a high underestimation of the number of infected and recovered people in the population, which will hopefully lower the death toll.

Data on confirmed cases diagnosed outside China were analyzed using statistical models to estimate the impact of travel reduction on three epidemiological outcome measures: (i) the number of exported cases, (ii) the probability of a major epidemic, and (iii) the time delay to a major epidemic. From 28 January to 7 February 2020, we estimated that 226 exported cases (95% confidence interval: 86, 449) were prevented, corresponding to a 70.4% reduction in incidence compared to the counterfactual scenario. The reduced probability of a major epidemic ranged from 7% to 20% in Japan, which resulted in a median time delay to a major epidemic of two days. Depending on the scenario, the estimated delay may be less than one day. As the delay is small, the decision to control travel volume through restrictions on freedom of movement should be balanced between the resulting estimated epidemiological impact and predicted economic fallout.

Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percen-tile). These values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations. Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the first cases had their symptom onset in December 2019 [1]. This newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2]. The key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3-5] and the transmission potential [6,7]. In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses. Here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the early outbreak phase, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates. Travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, reported symptom onset data and reported travel history In January 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV were detected outside Wuhan. For 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 January, the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for four cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in Wuhan. Consequently, their time spent in Wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. Of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were Wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in Wuhan for a limited time. By taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases. Using the duration of stay in Wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of possible values for the incubation period of each case. We fitted three parametric forms for the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the Weibull distribution, the gamma distribution and the lognormal distribution. We used a Bayesian approach to fitting that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. We specified strictly positive flat prior probability distributions</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bai, Yuxiao</author><author>Nie, Xun</author><author>Wen, Chenxin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemic Prediction of 2019-nCoV in Hubei Province and Comparison with SARS in Guangdong Province</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3531427</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Since the first case of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, the virus has spread very rapidly in China on December 31st, with Hubei Province having the most severe epidemic situation. As of 24:00 on February 2nd, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province has reached up to 11,177. In this paper, we select the epidemic situation in Hubei Province as the research object to establish the SEIQDR model of infectious diseases. The parameters are determined from the existing data to predict the trend of the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses, and the parameters are adjusted according to the prevention and control measures as well as possible changes. In comparison with Guangdong Province, where the SARS epidemic originated, it was concluded that the new coronavirus epidemic far exceeds the SARS epidemic in terms of infection rate and deaths. But thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the country, currently the epidemic is under control, and we predict the end of the epidemic is about 60 days earlier than the SARS virus. The total number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 26,701 (ranges from 24,355 to 32,406), and the rapid growth period is expected to be from January 27th to February 10, and the epidemic will grow slowly after February 22nd.

The first priority for prevention and treatment of the disease is to find the pathogenicity of 2019-nCoV in vivo. Weight loss and virus replication were detected in infected-hACE2 mice. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with significant inflammatory cells infiltration around the bronchioles and blood vessels, and viral antigens were observed in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells. The phenomenon was not found in wild type mice infected with 2019-nCoV and the mock-infected hACE2 mice. The pathogenicity of 2019-nCoV in hACE2 mice was clarified and the Koch's postulates was fulfilled as well, and the model may facilitate the development of therapeutics and vaccines against 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartoszewicz, Jakub M</author><author>Seidel, Anja</author><author>Renard, Bernhard Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.925354</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.925354</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/01/2020.01.29.925354.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baruah, V</author><author>Bose, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunoinformatics-aided identification of T cell and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epitope prediction</keyword><keyword>immunoinformatics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0146-6615</isbn><accession-num>32022276</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25698</electronic-resource-num><notes>1096-9071

This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding MHC class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for development of 2019-nCoV vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd &amp;lt; 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benvenuto, Domenico</author><author>Giovanetti, Marta</author><author>Salemi, Marco</author><author>Prosperi, Mattia</author><author>De Flora, Cecilia</author><author>Junior Alcantara, Luiz Carlos</author><author>Angeletti, Silvia</author><author>Ciccozzi, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The global spread of 2019-nCoV: a molecular evolutionary analysis</title><secondary-title>Pathogens and Global Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pathogens and Global Health</full-title></periodical><pages>1-4</pages><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>molecular Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>phylogeny</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/20477724.2020.1725339</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20477724.2020.1725339</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>ABSTRACTThe global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high.

In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernard Stoecklin, Sibylle</author><author>Rolland, Patrick</author><author>Silue, Yassoungo</author><author>Mailles, Alexandra</author><author>Campese, Christine</author><author>Simondon, Anne</author><author>Mechain, Matthieu</author><author>Meurice, Laure</author><author>Nguyen, Mathieu</author><author>Bassi, Clément</author><author>Yamani, Estelle</author><author>Behillil, Sylvie</author><author>Ismael, Sophie</author><author>Nguyen, Duc</author><author>Malvy, Denis</author><author>Lescure, François Xavier</author><author>Georges, Scarlett</author><author>Lazarus, Clément</author><author>Tabaï, Anouk</author><author>Stempfelet, Morgane</author><author>Enouf, Vincent</author><author>Coignard, Bruno</author><author>Levy-Bruhl, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in France: surveillance, investigations and control measures, January 2020</title><secondary-title>Eurosurveillance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eurosurveillance</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Euro Surveill</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernheim, Adam</author><author>Mei, Xueyan</author><author>Huang, Mingqian</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Fayad, Zahi A.</author><author>Zhang, Ning</author><author>Diao, Kaiyue</author><author>Lin, Bin</author><author>Zhu, Xiqi</author><author>Li, Kunwei</author><author>Li, Shaolin</author><author>Shan, Hong</author><author>Jacobi, Adam</author><author>Chung, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chest CT Findings in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Relationship to Duration of Infection</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200463</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher> Radiological Society of North America </publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200463</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200463</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from four centers in China from January 18, 2020 to February 2, 2020 were...</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blumberg, Seth</author><author>Lietman, Thomas M</author><author>Porco, Travis C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the plausibility of subcritical transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.20021311</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.20021311</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Abstract: The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread. While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.

Since the end of January, the ratio of fatalities per infection is about 2% and remarkably stable. The increase appears to be roughly exponential, but with an e-folding time that gradually increases from just two days at the end of January to about ten days by February 9. Here we show that, since January 20, the number of fatalities and infections increases quadratically and not exponentially, as widely believed. At present, no departure from this behavior can be seen, allowing tentative predictions to be made for the next 1-2 months.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, Samantha K</author><author>Webster, Rebecca K</author><author>Smith, Louise E</author><author>Woodland, Lisa</author><author>Wessely, Simon</author><author>Neil Greenberg, FMedSci</author><author>James Rubin, FRCPsych G</author><author>Wessely FMedSci, Simon</author><author>Greenberg FRCPsych, Neil</author><author>James Rubin, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Infectious diseases</keyword><keyword>Isolation</keyword><keyword>Mental health</keyword><keyword>Psychological well being</keyword><keyword>Quarantine</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>nCov</keyword></keywords><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3532534</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The January 2020 coronavirus outbreak has seen many countries plan to 'self-isolate' or quarantine people who have potentially come into contact with the infection. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on best available evidence. We conducted a rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. 3166 papers were found and 24 included in the review. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss and stigma. Some suggested long-lasting effects. Where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine for no longer than necessary; provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be beneficial.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bu, Jin</author><author>Peng, Dong-Dong</author><author>Xiao, Hui</author><author>Yue, Qian</author><author>Han, Yan</author><author>Lin, Yu</author><author>Hu, Gang</author><author>Chen, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of meteorological conditions and prediction of epidemic trend of 2019-nCoV infection in 2020</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022715</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022715</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: To investigate the meteorological condition for incidence and spread of 2019-nCoV infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease. Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.

Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.

As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city&amp;#039;s lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (2016QY02D0305), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71621002, 71771213, 71790615, 71972164 and 91846301), Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDRW-XH-2017-3), and the Hunan Science and Technology Plan Project (2017RS3040, 2018JJ1034).

Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS. We confirm high sequence similarity (&amp;gt;99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chai, Xiaoqiang</author><author>Hu, Longfei</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author><author>Han, Weiyu</author><author>Lu, Zhou</author><author>Ke, Aiwu</author><author>Zhou, Jian</author><author>Shi, Guoming</author><author>Fang, Nan</author><author>Fan, Jia</author><author>Cai, Jiabin</author><author>Fan, Jue</author><author>Lan, Fei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.931766</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.931766</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.03.931766.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo</author><author>Kok, Kin-Hang</author><author>Zhu, Zheng</author><author>Chu, Hin</author><author>To, Kelvin Kai-Wang</author><author>Yuan, Shuofeng</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan</title><secondary-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</full-title></periodical><pages>221-236</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>emerging</keyword><keyword>genome</keyword><keyword>respiratory</keyword><keyword>virus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31987001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902</electronic-resource-num><notes>31987001[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31987001[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31987001</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo</author><author>Yuan, Shuofeng</author><author>Kok, Kin-Hang</author><author>To, Kelvin Kai-Wang</author><author>Chu, Hin</author><author>Yang, Jin</author><author>Xing, Fanfan</author><author>Liu, Jieling</author><author>Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan</author><author>Poon, Rosana Wing-Shan</author><author>Tsoi, Hoi-Wah</author><author>Lo, Simon Kam-Fai</author><author>Chan, Kwok-Hung</author><author>Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man</author><author>Chan, Wan-Mui</author><author>Ip, Jonathan Daniel</author><author>Cai, Jian-Piao</author><author>Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung</author><author>Chen, Honglin</author><author>Hui, Christopher Kim-Ming</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster</title><secondary-title>Lancet (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lancet (London, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>S0140-6736(20)30154-9</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31986261</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>31986261[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30154-9[PII]</notes><research-notes>31986261[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30154-9[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986261</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

Many state-of-the-art researches  focus on predicting infection scale or threshold. Few researchers pay attention to the predicting of infection nodes from a snapshot. With developing of precision marketing,  recommending and, controlling, how to predict infection nodes precisely from snapshot becomes a key issue in spreading dynamics analysis.  In this paper, a probability based prediction model is presented so as to estimate the infection nodes from a snapshot of spreading. Experimental results on synthetic and real networks demonstrate that the model proposed could predict the infection nodes precisely in the sense of probability.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Guang</author><author>Wu, Di</author><author>Guo, Wei</author><author>Cao, Yong</author><author>Huang, Da</author><author>Wang, Hongwu</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoyun</author><author>Chen, Huilong</author><author>Yu, Haijing</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoping</author><author>Zhang, Minxia</author><author>Wu, Shiji</author><author>Song, Jianxin</author><author>Chen, Tao</author><author>Han, Meifang</author><author>Li, Shusheng</author><author>Luo, Xiaoping</author><author>Zhao, Jianping</author><author>Ning, Qin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and immunologic features in severe and moderate forms of Coronavirus Disease 2019</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.16.20023903</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.16.20023903</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background Since late December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia cases caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and continued to spread throughout China and across the globe. To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.

Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, L</author><author>Liu, W</author><author>Zhang, Q</author><author>Xu, K</author><author>Ye, G</author><author>Wu, W</author><author>Sun, Z</author><author>Liu, F</author><author>Wu, K</author><author>Zhong, B</author><author>Mei, Y</author><author>Zhang, W</author><author>Chen, Y</author><author>Li, Y</author><author>Shi, M</author><author>Lan, K</author><author>Liu, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA based mNGS approach identifies a novel human coronavirus from two individual pneumonia cases in 2019 Wuhan outbreak</title><secondary-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</full-title></periodical><pages>313-319</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Wuhan pneumonia</keyword><keyword>metagenomic next-generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>phylogenetic analyses</keyword><keyword>virus evolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>2222-1751</isbn><accession-num>32020836</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1725399</electronic-resource-num><notes>2222-1751

We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into beta-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Nanshan</author><author>Zhou, Min</author><author>Dong, Xuan</author><author>Qu, Jieming</author><author>Gong, Fengyun</author><author>Han, Yang</author><author>Qiu, Yang</author><author>Wang, Jingli</author><author>Liu, Ying</author><author>Wei, Yuan</author><author>Xia, Jia'an</author><author>Yu, Ting</author><author>Zhang, Xinxin</author><author>Zhang, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study</title><secondary-title>Lancet (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lancet (London, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>S0140-6736(20)30211-7</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>32007143</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>32007143[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30211-7[PII]</notes><research-notes>32007143[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30211-7[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.

The cause and consequence of the outbreak remain largely unknown as it is still in its early stage. As many aspects of the new virus are similar to SARS in 2003, knowledge, patterns and lessons of the SARS-CoV outbreak are valuable resources for responding to the Wuhan 2019-nCoV outbreak. Using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, we assessed and compared the characteristics of those two outbreaks and predicted the possible outcome for the current 2019-nCoV outbreak. Like the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV has a high human-to-human transmission capability and healthcare workers and family members are high risk populations. Because the early outbreak stage coincides with the Chinese spring festival travel rush, it is a challenge to prevent and control the spread of the virus. In this situation, the emergence and movement of a 2019-nCoV super-spreader is difficult to identify. Using the reported case data so far (as of Jan 23, 2019), a logistic model was built and the cumulative and daily counts of the 2019-nCoV cases were predicted. The cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. Regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent emergence and movement of a super-spreader. There is an urgent need to establish enhanced surveillance and implement efficient measures nationwide to control this epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Vincent C C</author><author>Wong, Shuk-Ching</author><author>To, Kelvin K W</author><author>Ho, P L</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preparedness and proactive infection control measures against the emerging Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia in China</title><secondary-title>The Journal of hospital infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of hospital infection</full-title></periodical><pages>S0195-6701(20)30034-7</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31962139</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.010</electronic-resource-num><notes>31962139[pmid] S0195-6701(20)30034-7[PII]</notes><research-notes>31962139[pmid] S0195-6701(20)30034-7[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31962139</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Yichun</author><author>Luo, Ran</author><author>Wang, Kun</author><author>Zhang, Meng</author><author>Wang, Zhixiang</author><author>Dong, Lei</author><author>Li, Junhua</author><author>Yao, Ying</author><author>Ge, Shuwang</author><author>Xu, Gang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Kidney impairment is associated with in-hospital death of COVID-19 patients</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.18.20023242</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.18.20023242</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. Clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community. ### Competing Interest Statement All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: no support from any organisation for the submitted work; MEH reports grants from National Institute of General Medical Sciences, during the conduct of the study; AV reports grants and personal fees from Metabiota inc., outside the submitted work; MC and APyP report grants from Metabiota inc., outside the submitted work; HY reports grants from Glaxosmithkline (China) Investment Co., Ltd, grants from Yichang HEC Changjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, grants from Sanofi Pasteur, grants from Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Company, outside the submitted work.

Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementGC acknowledges support from NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chung, Michael</author><author>Bernheim, Adam</author><author>Mei, Xueyan</author><author>Zhang, Ning</author><author>Huang, Mingqian</author><author>Zeng, Xianjian</author><author>Cui, Jiufa</author><author>Xu, Wenjian</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Fayad, Zahi</author><author>Jacobi, Adam</author><author>Li, Kunwei</author><author>Li, Shaolin</author><author>Shan, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200230</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>32017661</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200230</electronic-resource-num><notes>32017661[pmid]</notes><research-notes>32017661[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017661</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reviewed with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings.

This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clifford, Samuel J</author><author>Klepac, Petra</author><author>Zandvoort, Kevin Van</author><author>Quilty, Billy J</author><author>group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author><author>Flasche, Stefan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.12.20022426</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objectives: To determine if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Design: Simulation study Setting: Countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions Participants: Infected air travellers Interventions: Syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset. Main outcome measures: The achievable delay until a major local outbreak is likely to occur Results: We evaluated traveller sensitisation effectiveness in reducing the number of secondary cases of 30, 50 and 70%, and assumed either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. Early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. For 50% sensitisation effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 7 days). The possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher R0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. Syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance outbreak delays. In combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. In 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 111 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 23 days) for 1 infected traveller per week and at least 9 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 4 days) for 10 infected travellers per week. Conclusion: Air-traveller targeted interventions, particularly in combination, can delay local SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the magnitude of a few weeks to potentially even months if the number of infected travellers remains low.

However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus.

We use a compartmental model fit to the existing data. The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet. Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>del Rio, Carlos</author><author>Malani, Preeti N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019 Novel Coronavirus—Important Information for Clinicians</title><secondary-title>JAMA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0098-7484</isbn><accession-num>32022836</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jama.2020.1490</electronic-resource-num><notes>1538-3598

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dennis Lo, Y M</author><author>Chiu, Rossa W K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Racing towards the development of diagnostics for a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>Clinical Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Chemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>hvaa038</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/clinchem/hvaa038</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031590</url><url>https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/advance-article/doi/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa038/5729988</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diao, Bo</author><author>Wang, Chenhui</author><author>Tan, Yingjun</author><author>Chen, Xiewan</author><author>Liu, Ying</author><author>Ning, Lifeng</author><author>Chen, Li</author><author>Li, Min</author><author>Liu, Yueping</author><author>Wang, Gang</author><author>Yuan, Zilin</author><author>Feng, Zeqing</author><author>Wu, Yuzhang</author><author>Chen, Yongwen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reduction and Functional Exhaustion of T Cells in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.18.20024364</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the WHO. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (≥60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, or 400/μL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, and 400/μL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.

However, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4±15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15±17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.

Structure analysis of the spike (S) protein of this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection. These data are important to guide design of infection control policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-nCov when results of direct laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Okell, Lucy</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Baguelin, Marc</author><author>Bhatia, Sangeeta</author><author>Boonyasiri, Adhiratha</author><author>Cucunubá, Zulma</author><author>Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina</author><author>Fitzjohn, Rich</author><author>Fu, Han</author><author>Gaythorpe, Katy</author><author>Hamlet, Arran</author><author>Hinsley, Wes</author><author>Hong, Nan</author><author>Kwun, Min</author><author>Laydon, Daniel</author><author>Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Van Elsland, Sabine</author><author>Volz, Erik</author><author>Wang, Haowei</author><author>Wang, Raymond</author><author>Walters, Caroline</author><author>Xi, Xiaoyue</author><author>Donnelly, Christl</author><author>Ghani, Azra</author><author>Ferguson, Neil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Report 4: Severity of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV)</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Dorigatti et al. - Unknown - Report 4 Severity of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We present case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for three strata of 2019-nCoV infections. For cases detected in Hubei, we estimate the CFR to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). For cases detected in travellers outside mainland China, we obtain central estimates of the CFR in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Zhanwei</author><author>Wang, Lin</author><author>Cauchemez, Simon</author><author>Xu, Xiaoke</author><author>Wang, Xianwen</author><author>Cowling, Benjamin J.</author><author>Meyers, Lauren Ancel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan quarantine</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.20019299</pages><issue>Jan 30</issue><keywords><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>importation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Du et al. - 2020 - ​Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan.pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Du et al. - 2020 - ​Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299v3.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>On January 23, 2020, China quarantined Wuhan to contain an emerging coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eurosurveillance Editorial, Team</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Note from the editors: World Health Organization declares novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sixth public health emergency of international concern</title><secondary-title>Euro Surveill</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro Surveill</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1025-496x</isbn><accession-num>32019636</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.200131e</electronic-resource-num><notes>1560-7917

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.

No approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-nCoV or any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feng, Zhichao</author><author>Yu, Qizhi</author><author>Yao, Shanhu</author><author>Luo, Lei</author><author>Duan, Junhong</author><author>Yan, Zhimin</author><author>Yang, Min</author><author>Tan, Hongpei</author><author>Ma, Mengtian</author><author>Li, Ting</author><author>Yi, Dali</author><author>Mi, Ze</author><author>Zhao, Huafei</author><author>Jiang, Yi</author><author>He, Zhenhu</author><author>Li, Huiling</author><author>Nie, Wei</author><author>Liu, Yin</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author><author>Luo, Muqing</author><author>Liu, Xuanhui</author><author>Rong, Pengfei</author><author>Wang, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early Prediction of Disease Progression in 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Patients Outside Wuhan with CT and Clinical Characteristics</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025296</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025296</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: To determine the predictive value of CT and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P &gt; 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.

As of February 7, 2020, 44 strains of the virus have been sequenced and uploaded to NCBI's GenBank, providing insight into the virus's evolutionary history and pathogenesis. Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a track-based representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research. Our Virus Browser portal can be accessed at https://virusgateway.wustl.edu, and documentation is available at https://virusgateway.readthedocs.io/.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Xinmiao</author><author>Ying, Qi</author><author>Zeng, Tieyong</author><author>Long, Tao</author><author>Wang, Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regression Analyses</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.16.20023564</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.16.20023564</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Fu et al. - 2020 - Simulating and Forecasting the Cumulative Confirmed Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in China by Boltzmann Function-based Regressi.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>An ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is hitting Wuhan City and has spread to other provinces/cities of China and overseas. It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work is support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31972918 and 31770830 to XF). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statement This study was partially supported by the ANR project DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03) to VC; the EU grant MOOD (H2020-874850) to MG, CP, MK, PYB, VC.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamic of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23(rd) January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus 2 closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GeneBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on the 25th November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. This article is protected by copyright.

With almost 65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February 2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population, COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002–2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gorbalenya, Alexander E</author><author>Baker, Susan C</author><author>Baric, Ralph S</author><author>de Groot, Raoul J</author><author>Drosten, Christian</author><author>Gulyaeva, Anastasia A</author><author>Haagmans, Bart L</author><author>Lauber, Chris</author><author>Leontovich, Andrey M</author><author>Neuman, Benjamin W</author><author>Penzar, Dmitry</author><author>Perlman, Stanley</author><author>Poon, Leo LM</author><author>Samborskiy, Dmitry</author><author>Sidorov, Igor A</author><author>Sola, Isabel</author><author>Ziebuhr, John</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus – The species and its viruses, a statement of the Coronavirus Study Group</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.07.937862</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.07.937862</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Gorbalenya et al. - Unknown - Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus The species and its viruses-a statement of the Coron.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.937862</url><url>http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/02/11/2020.02.07.937862.abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The present outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections, including respiratory distress syndrome, is the third spillover, in only two decades, of an animal coronavirus to humans resulting in a major epidemic. Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gorse, Geoffrey J.</author><author>Donovan, Mary M.</author><author>Patel, Gira B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibodies to Coronaviruses Are Higher in Older Compared with Younger Adults and Binding Antibodies Are More Sensitive than Neutralizing Antibodies in Identifying Coronavirus‐Associated Illnesses</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>jmv.25715</pages><keywords><keyword>antibody</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>immunity</keyword><keyword>neutralization</keyword><keyword>respiratory illness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25715</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25715</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gostic, Katelyn</author><author>Gomez, Ana C R</author><author>Mummah, Riley O</author><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Lloyd-Smith, James O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.20019224</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.28.20019224.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKG was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship in the program for understanding dynamic &amp;amp; multiscale systems from the James S.

However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Group of Interventional Respiratory Medicine, Chinese Thoracic Society</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expert consensus for bronchoscopy during the epidemic of 2019 Novel Coronavirus infection (Trial version)</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>E006-E006</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>2019 Novel Coronavirus infection</keyword><keyword>Bronchoscopy</keyword><keyword>Indications</keyword><keyword>Prevention and protection</keyword><keyword>Sampling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>China</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0006</electronic-resource-num><language>chi</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32033514</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Infection with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, airborne transmission and direct contact.

According to the characteristics of bronchoscopy, it is necessary to formulate the procedure, requirements and precautions when conducting bronchoscopy in the current epidemic situation. Relevant standards for preventing from infections should be strictly implemented in the operation of bronchoscopy. It needs to emphasize that bronchoscopy should not be used as a routine means for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection sampling.

The SARS-CoV-2 was identified to be in the Betacoronavirus genera which also includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of the viral genes might be subjected to selection pressure from different hosts or environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses could help to identify viral host origins and evolutionary trends, however similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in coronavirus viral sequences. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guan, Wei-jie</author><author>Ni, Zheng-yi</author><author>Hu, Yu</author><author>Liang, Wen-hua</author><author>Ou, Chun-quan</author><author>He, Jian-xing</author><author>Liu, Lei</author><author>Shan, Hong</author><author>Lei, Chun-liang</author><author>Hui, David S C</author><author>Du, Bin</author><author>Li, Lan-juan</author><author>Zeng, Guang</author><author>Yuen, Kowk-Yung</author><author>Chen, Ru-chong</author><author>Tang, Chun-li</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Chen, Ping-yan</author><author>Xiang, Jie</author><author>Li, Shi-yue</author><author>Wang, Jin-lin</author><author>Liang, Zi-jing</author><author>Peng, Yi-xiang</author><author>Wei, Li</author><author>Liu, Yong</author><author>Hu, Ya-hua</author><author>Peng, Peng</author><author>Wang, Jian-ming</author><author>Liu, Ji-yang</author><author>Chen, Zhong</author><author>Li, Gang</author><author>Zheng, Zhi-jian</author><author>Qiu, Shao-qin</author><author>Luo, Jie</author><author>Ye, Chang-jiang</author><author>Zhu, Shao-yong</author><author>Zhong, Nan-shan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.06.20020974</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/02/09/2020.02.06.20020974.abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P&amp;amp;lt;0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNAFunding StatementSupported by Ministry of Science and Technology, National Health Commission, National Natural Science Foundation, Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.One Sentence Summary It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Habibzadeh, P</author><author>Stoneman, E K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Novel Coronavirus: A Bird's Eye View</title><secondary-title>Int J Occup Environ Med</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Int J Occup Environ Med</full-title></periodical><pages>65-71</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Emerging viruses</keyword><keyword>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>SARS coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>2008-6520</isbn><accession-num>32020915</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15171/ijoem.2020.1921</electronic-resource-num><notes>2008-6814

Since then, there have been over 4000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (n-CoV) and over 100 deaths. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on 2019 n-CoV and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the 2019 n-CoV outbreak. Methodology: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In January 2020, available information on 2019 n-CoV was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For 2019 n-CoV, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Interpretation: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for 2019 n-CoV, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Jiahua</author><author>Tao, Huanyu</author><author>Yan, Yumeng</author><author>Huang, Sheng-You</author><author>Xiao, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular mechanism of evolution and human infection with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.17.952903</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.17.952903</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Since December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has hit the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province. With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019- nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Xiang</author><author>Zhang, Lei</author><author>Ran, Qin</author><author>Xiong, Anying</author><author>Wang, Junyi</author><author>Wu, Dehong</author><author>Chen, Feng</author><author>Li, Guoping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20020206</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20020206</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.03.20020206.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings could explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Nevertheless, estimating $R_0$ for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of $R_0$ and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40\% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$ when predicting epidemic size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hellewell, Joel</author><author>Abbott, Sam</author><author>Gimma, Amy</author><author>Bosse, Nikos I</author><author>Jarvis, Christopher I</author><author>Russell, Timothy W</author><author>Munday, James D</author><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Edmunds, W John</author><author>group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.20021162</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

In addition, all available data up to February 3 were processed the same way. For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data reported until the time of writing . Using this model and the first set of data, we estimate that the maximum cases will be about 21,000 reaching this level in mid-February. Using all available data the maximum number of cases is somewhat higher at 29,000 but its dynamics does not change. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe funding agencies had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention.One sentence summary The novel 2019 coronavirus and the SARS-coronavirus share central biological properties which can guide risk assessment and intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holshue, Michelle L</author><author>DeBolt, Chas</author><author>Lindquist, Scott</author><author>Lofy, Kathy H</author><author>Wiesman, John</author><author>Bruce, Hollianne</author><author>Spitters, Christopher</author><author>Ericson, Keith</author><author>Wilkerson, Sara</author><author>Tural, Ahmet</author><author>Diaz, George</author><author>Cohn, Amanda</author><author>Fox, LeAnne</author><author>Patel, Anita</author><author>Gerber, Susan I</author><author>Kim, Lindsay</author><author>Tong, Suxiang</author><author>Lu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Lindstrom, Steve</author><author>Pallansch, Mark A</author><author>Weldon, William C</author><author>Biggs, Holly M</author><author>Uyeki, Timothy M</author><author>Pillai, Satish K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMoa2001191</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Medical Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</electronic-resource-num><notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</notes><research-notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</url><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hou, Tieying</author><author>Zeng, Weiqi</author><author>Yang, Minling</author><author>Chen, Wenjing</author><author>Ren, Lili</author><author>Ai, Jingwen</author><author>Wu, Ji</author><author>Liao, Yalong</author><author>Gou, Xuejing</author><author>Li, Yongjun</author><author>Wang, Xiaorui</author><author>Su, Hang</author><author>Wang, Jianwei</author><author>Gu, Bing</author><author>Xu, Teng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and Evaluation of A CRISPR-based Diagnostic For 2019-novel Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.22.20025460</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.22.20025460</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: The recent outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), the third zoonotic CoV has raised great public health concern. The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR. Conclusion: CRISPR-nCoV presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen.

Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P&lt;0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged.

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Yeen</author><author>Zhao, Ning</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025395</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025395</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019. This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 603 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 34.0%, 18.1%, and 18.1%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than older people (P=0.024). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P=0.045). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (&lt; 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.

We estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18 th January 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable-with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Donnelly, Christl</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Report 2: Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - Unknown - Report 2 Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China V2 (updated to include second Thai case)</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - Unknown - Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China V2 (updated to include sec.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Incident Room Surveillance Team, National</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communicable Diseases Intelligence 2020 - COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 3: Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>acute respiratory disease</keyword><keyword>case definition</keyword><keyword>coronavirus disease 2019</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>novel coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.33321/cdi.2020.44.15</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.15</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jaimes, Javier A.</author><author>Andre, Nicole M</author><author>Millet, Jean K</author><author>Whittaker, Gary R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation loop as a distinguishing feature compared to SARS-CoV and related SARS-like coronaviruses</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.942185</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.942185</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Jaimes et al. - 2020 - Structural modeling of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV) spike protein reveals a proteolytically-sensitive activation.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06196</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern. Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ji, Wei</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Zhao, Xiaofang</author><author>Zai, Junjie</author><author>Li, Xingguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross-species transmission from snake to human</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1002/jmv.25682</pages><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>RSCU</keyword><keyword>cross-species transmission</keyword><keyword>phylogenetic analysis</keyword><keyword>recombination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31967321</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25682</electronic-resource-num><notes>31967321[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31967321[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31967321</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans.

and then named &quot;2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020. For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ju, Jingyue</author><author>Kumar, Shiv</author><author>Li, Xiaoxu</author><author>Jockusch, Steffen</author><author>Russo, James J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.927574</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.927574</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/31/2020.01.30.927574.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies.

To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3’-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection: Inference using exported cases</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.20019547</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.29.20019547.abstract</url><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.29.20019547.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection who were confirmed in other countries provide a chance to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic. The proposed approach can provide insights into early risk assessment using only publicly available data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementH.N. received funding from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [grant number: JP18fk0108050]; the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [grant numbers, H.N.: 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074; R.K.: 18J21587], the Inamori Foundation, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number&amp;mdash;the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a na&amp;iuml;ve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Thompson, Robin N</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological identification of a novel infectious disease in real time: Analysis of the atypical pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2019-20</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.26.20018887</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.26.20018887</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/03/2020.01.26.20018887.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: Virological tests indicate that a novel coronavirus is the most likely explanation for the 2019-20 pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to &quot;Disease X&quot; (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to provide evidence of human-to-human transmission. Methods: A confirmed case of 2019-nCoV was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of 2019-nCoV in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of the confirmed cases were collected from their medical records. Exposure and travel histories were obtained by interviewing the confirmed cases. Results: Seventeen confirmed cases were identified from January 1 to 21, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, two cases (11.8%) arisen locally without travel history to Wuhan or exposure history to wildlife market within 14 days prior to the onset of illness. These two cases were from two family cluster infections including 4 and 2 index cases, respectively. The whole viral genome from the two cases was exactly the same with their index cases, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) which were predicted to cause one amino acid change in spike protein and Orf8 protein, respectively. Conclusions: This study identified two human-to-human transmitted cases of 2019-nCoV in Guangdong Province, China, which indicates that prevention strategies of cutting the person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV in households, hospitals and communities are urgently implemented.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606200, 2018YFA0606202), the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (2018B020207006, 2019B020208005, 2019B111103001), Guangzhou Science and technology Plan Project (201804010383).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.

The majority of these cases (58.3%; n=14) were male, with a median age of 42 years (range, 21-62 years). Of the confirmed cases, 15 were index cases (63%), six were first-generation patients (24%), and three were second-generation patients (12.5%). All the first- and second-generation patients were family members or close acquaintances of index cases. All the index cases entered the South Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.6 days (median, 4 days) and the reproduction number (R0) was calculated as 0.5. Two of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic. As of February 8, 22 patients with 2019-nCoV are hospitalized in South Korea, and 2 have been discharged from the hospital. The epidemiological indicators will be revised as new information becomes available in the future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers around the world is essential for efficient preparations and responses to new infectious diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Jin Yong</author><author>Choe, Pyoeng Gyun</author><author>Oh, Yoonju</author><author>Oh, Kyung Joong</author><author>Kim, Jinsil</author><author>Park, So Jeong</author><author>Park, Ji Hye</author><author>Na, Hye Kyoung</author><author>Oh, Myoung Don</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Imported into Korea from Wuhan, China: Implication for Infection Prevention and Control Measures</title><secondary-title>Journal of Korean medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Korean medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>e61-e61</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Korea (South)</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e61</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32030925</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China.

Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.

Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Viral activate MCs release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Russell, Timothy W</author><author>Diamond, Charlie</author><author>Group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author><author>Group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV: a mathematical modelling study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.31.20019901</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Kucharski et al. - 2020 - Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV a mathematical modelling study(2).pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Kucharski et al. - 2020 - Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV a mathematical modelling study.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.31.20019901.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grants 206250/Z/17/Z and 210758/Z/18/Z) and HDR UK (grant: MR/S003975/1). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, mean age 55 ± 16 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their condition. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV coronavirus pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwok, Kin On</author><author>Wong, Valerie</author><author>Wei, Vivian Wan In</author><author>Wong, Samuel Yeung Shan</author><author>Tang, Julian Wei-Tze</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases in Hong Kong and implications for further spread</title><secondary-title>Journal of Infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Infection</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>W.B.

The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.

The two models used to estimate the reproduction number (coalescent−based exponential growth and a birth−death skyline method) indicated an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 7.8 x 10−4 subs/site/year (range 1.1x10−4−15x10−4). The estimated R value was 2.6 (range 2.1−5.1), and increased from 0.8 to 2.4 in December 2019. The estimated mean doubling time of the epidemic was between 3.6 and 4.1 days. This study proves the usefulness of phylogeny in supporting the surveillance of emerging new infections even as the epidemic is growing.

Design: Travel network-based modelling study. Setting and participants: General population travelling from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China. Main outcome measures: Based on de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports, we defined the relative importation risk and internal and international destinations of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China, and a high proportion of cases likely travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak. Should secondary outbreaks occur in 17 high-risk secondary cities, they could contribute to seeding the virus in other highly connected cities within and beyond China after the LNY holiday. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases seen. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the grants from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1134076); the European Union Horizon 2020 (MOOD 874850); the National Natural Science Fund of China (81773498, 71771213, 91846301); National Science and Technology Major Project of China (2016ZX10004222-009, 2018ZX10201001-010, 2018ZX10713001-007, 2017ZX10103009-005); Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader (18XD1400300); Hunan Science and Technology Plan Project (2017RS3040, 2018JJ1034).

This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lamb, Laura E</author><author>Bartolone, Sarah N</author><author>Ward, Elijah</author><author>Chancellor, Michael B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025155</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025155</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.

To better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound with the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 angstrom resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analyzed with the 2019-nCoV RBD, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lauer, Stephen A</author><author>Grantz, Kyra H</author><author>Bi, Qifang</author><author>Jones, Forrest K</author><author>Zheng, Qulu</author><author>Meredith, Hannah</author><author>Azman, Andrew S</author><author>Reich, Nicholas G</author><author>Lessler, Justin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The incubation period of 2019-nCoV from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.02.20020016</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.02.20020016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.02.20020016.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified in China in December, 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine.

As of Feb 1, 2020, at least 11,844 cases had been diagnosed in China, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report have suggest that novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a new recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronavirus and could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Letko, Michael</author><author>Munster, Vincent</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for lineage B β-coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.22.915660</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.22.915660</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/22/2020.01.22.915660.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leung, Char</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the distribution of the incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection between travelers to Hubei, China and non-travelers</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022822</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022822</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objectives: Amid the continuing spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the incubation period of COVID-19 should be regularly re-assessed as more information is available upon the increase in reported cases. The present work estimated the distribution of incubation periods of patients infected in and outside Hubei province of China. Methods: Clinical data were collected from the individual cases reported by the media as they were not fully available on the official pages of the Chinese health authorities. MLE was used to estimate the distributions of the incubation period. Results: It was found that the incubation period of patients with no travel history to Hubei was longer and more volatile. Conclusion: It is recommended that the duration of quarantine should be extended to at least 3 weeks.

The traffic blockage and quarantine can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections. Evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. We apply our Flow-SEIR model to estimate the number of infections as well as the evaluate the policy of traffic blockage and quarantine, based on the data of confirmed case and the migration in China. We define two factors related to traffic blockage and quarantine to estimate the efficacy of these two intervation measures. In our study, since the public are urged to stay at home and self-protective, the self-protection at home is also accounted as a part of quarantine. In the simulated results, the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, when the quarantine factor ε is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak number of infections will decrease by 89.68%. And the traffic blockage is also effective, however, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of the infections. For Hubei Province, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 24.26% - 25.33%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%. For the other provinces outside Hubei, if the quarantine is one week of earlier, the peak number will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%. If there is one day in advance for urban blockage, about 3,600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. If there is one day of delay, about 1,800 people will finally be at risk. In general, the effect of quarantine is even stronger than the traffic blockage control. The fact should not be ignored that there are still a large number of population who are exposed to the SARS-COV-2 but not yet symptomatic. Those exposed population is not easy to be found and infect others who are closely contacting with. So the traffic blockage and quarantine should be continued for a long time util the epidemic is totally under control. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding support ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. Immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in pathogenesis and clinical treatment.

Antiviral drugs commonly used in clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir, zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid for 2019-nCoV and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV include: remdesivir, lopinavir / ritonavir, lopinavir / ritonavir combined with interferon-beta, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. But the efficacy and safety of these drugs for 2019-nCoV pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Hong-Ying</author><author>Zhu, Guang-Jian</author><author>Zhang, Yun-Zhi</author><author>Zhang, Li-Biao</author><author>Hagan, Emily A</author><author>Martinez, Stephanie</author><author>Chmura, Aleksei A</author><author>Francisco, Leilani</author><author>Tai, Hina</author><author>Miller, Maureen</author><author>Daszak, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>OUP accepted manuscript</title><secondary-title>International Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Health</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>00</volume><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Zoonotic Risk</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>ethnographic</keyword><keyword>qualitative</keyword><keyword>rural communities</keyword><keyword>southern China</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/inthealth/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/inthealth/ihaa001/5732900</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. Methods: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. Results: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation. Conclusions: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Xie, Xiaoru</author><author>Cai, Xiaomei</author><author>Huang, Jian</author><author>Tian, Xuemei</author><author>Zhu, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Game consumption and the 2019 novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30063-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30063-3</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309920300633</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Li, Shilin</author><author>Cai, Yurui</author><author>Liu, Qin</author><author>Li, Xue</author><author>Zeng, Zhaoping</author><author>Chu, Yanpeng</author><author>Zhu, Fangcheng</author><author>Zeng, Fanxin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 17 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections Outside Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20022053</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20022053</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>An increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) infected with 2019-nCoV have been identified in Wuhan and other cities in China, since December 2019. We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster recovery and better therapeutic outcome.

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.

The key factors such as the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities over the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak. Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when outliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with $R_0:8\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large initial infected group.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Qilin</author><author>Ding, Xiuli</author><author>Xia, Geqing</author><author>Geng, Zhi</author><author>Chen, Fenghua</author><author>Wang, Lin</author><author>Wang, Zheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A simple laboratory parameter facilitates early identification of COVID-19 patients</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022830</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022830</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The total number of COVID-19 patients since the outbreak of this infection in Wuhan, China has reached 40000 and are still growing. To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations - rT16A and rA26F - were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations - rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N - were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV - host interaction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Xinhai</author><author>Zhao, Xumao</author><author>Lou, Yingqiang</author><author>Sun, Yuehua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk map of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China: proportionate control is needed</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.16.20023838</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.16.20023838</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background China is running a national level antivirus campaign against the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.

However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement None. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yi</author><author>Yin, Xianhong</author><author>Liang, Meng</author><author>Liu, Xiaoyu</author><author>Hao, Meng</author><author>Wang, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Note on NCP Diagnosis Number Prediction Model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025262</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025262</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>In December 2019, pneumonia infected with the novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N\_i/N\_(i-1) =〖(N\_(i-1)/N\_(i-2) )〗^α，where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and α was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10. Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact. However, new diagnosis will last to March.

As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.

From January 25 to January 29, 2020, we optimized 6 prediction models, 5 of them based on the number of medical observations to predicts the peak time of confirmed diagnosis will appear on the period of morning of January 29 from 24:00 to February 2 before 5 o'clock 24:00. Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24 o'clock on January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the 3rd has a small deviation from the actual value, and the actual value has always remained within the range predicted by the comprehensive prediction model 6. Therefore we discloses this finding and will continue to track whether this pattern can be maintained for longer. We believe that the changes medical observation case number may help to judge the trend of the epidemic situation in advance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lim, Jaegyun</author><author>Jeon, Seunghyun</author><author>Shin, Hyun-Young</author><author>Kim, Moon Jung</author><author>Seong, Yu Min</author><author>Lee, Wang Jun</author><author>Choe, Kang-Won</author><author>Kang, Yu Min</author><author>Lee, Baeckseung</author><author>Park, Sang-Joon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Case of the Index Patient Who Caused Tertiary Transmission of COVID-19 Infection in Korea: the Application of Lopinavir/Ritonavir for the Treatment of COVID-19 Infected Pneumonia Monitored by Quantitative RT-PCR</title><secondary-title>Journal of Korean Medical Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Korean Medical Science</full-title></periodical><volume>35</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Real-Time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain R</keyword><keyword>Tertiary Infection</keyword><keyword>Viral load</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e79</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://jkms.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e79</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Chenyao</author><author>Xiang, Jie</author><author>Yan, Mingzhe</author><author>Li, Hongze</author><author>Huang, Shuang</author><author>Shen, Changxin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens for viral nucleic acid detection in 52 cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.21.20026187</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.21.20026187</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>Abstract Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.

In this study, we built the structure models of two Wuhan pneumonia coronavirus proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 and papain like viral protease, by homology modeling, followed by docking ritonavir and lopinavir to the protease models, respectively. In all the simulations, the binding between ritonavir and coronavirus endopeptidase C30 was most suitable. In addition, both ritonavir and lopinavir seemed more suitable to bind to coronavirus endopeptidase C30 than papain like viral protease.

Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus infection: A statistical analysis of publicly available case data</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.26.20018754</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.26.20018754.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The geographic spread of persons infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) provides an opportunity to study the natural history of the newly emerged virus. Migration events put travelers at risk of infection for the duration of their exposure to an area where transmission is known to occur. Using publicly available data of the ongoing epidemic of 2019-nCoV where event dates for cases have been shared, the present study estimated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern interpretation of the epidemiological dynamics of 2019-nCoV infections. Our results show that the incubation periods falls within the range of two to nine days with 95% confidence, and the median incubation period is 4-5 days when approximated using the Weibull distribution, which was the best fit model. The median time from illness onset to hospitalization was estimated at 3 days. Based on the estimate of the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of isolation and quarantine should be at least nine days. We also note that the median time delay of 13.8 days from illness onset to death should be considered when estimating the case fatality risk of this novel virus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementH.N. received funding from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [grant number: JP18fk0108050]; the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [grant numbers, H.N.: 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074; R.K.: 18J21587], the Inamori Foundation, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.

We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age ≥ 50 and NLR &lt; 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process. Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.

We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan area，and explore its effective treatment. Methods：Retrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020；The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results： Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43（84.3%）patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan，and 4（7.7%） patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4（7.7%） patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])，Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])，all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])，most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P &lt;0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). Conclusion：In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia，Some patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This is a retrospective study.This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital. ### Funding Statement Funding: Project No.2020CDJGRH-YJ03 supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central 230 Universities.Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The funders had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Qinghe</author><author>Liu, Zhicheng</author><author>Li, Deqiang</author><author>Gao, Zefei</author><author>Zhu, Junkai</author><author>Yang, Junyan</author><author>Wang, Qiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the Tendency of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Outbreak in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.09.20021444</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Since December 1, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model in this paper to perform the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China. The results show that the number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6-10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of temporal infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 21721 (95% CI: 18764-24929). The peak arrival time is on March 3-9. The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12 to March 15. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000. According to Flow-SEHIR model and estimations from the data of evacuation of nationals from Wuhan, the real peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei is estimated to be 403481 (95% CI: 143284-1166936). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement no funding support ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and HongKong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong(R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. Conclusions: NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Xin</author><author>Wang, Xiu-Jie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential inhibitors for 2019-nCoV coronavirus M protease from clinically approved medicines</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.924100</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.924100</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/29/2020.01.29.924100.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms and rapid pandemic in China.

We reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of ARDS in COVID-19. Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined. Results: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male. With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%) died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%) developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in patients with ARDS. Conclusions: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19, and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial Not available ### Funding Statement Dr. Yu is supported by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Wuhan Municipality, grant number WX18A02. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission. This investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks. We found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Long, Justin B</author><author>Ehrenfeld, Jesse M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus.</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical systems</full-title></periodical><pages>59</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0148-5598</isbn><accession-num>32020374</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10916-020-1536-6</electronic-resource-num><notes>1573-689x

Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where &gt;50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction. Keyword: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, epidemics dynamics, diseases control, clinical features

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L; age &lt; 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age &lt; 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L, 0%) (P &lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received for this research. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNAFunding StatementMS and CP are partially supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01GM130668.

Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law t^μ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents μ = 2.1 ± 0.3. The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.

The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matsuda, Tomoko</author><author>Suzuki, Hikoyu</author><author>Ogata, Norichika</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenetic analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of invasion in Taiwan, the United States, and Japan</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08802</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people. The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analysing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCarty, Mark F.</author><author>DiNicolantonio, James J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nutraceuticals have potential for boosting the type 1 interferon response to RNA viruses including influenza and coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Prog Cardiovasc Dis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0033062020300372</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCloskey, B</author><author>Heymann, D L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SARS to novel coronavirus - old lessons and new lessons</title><secondary-title>Epidemiol Infect</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiol Infect</full-title></periodical><pages>e22</pages><volume>148</volume><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>Emerging Infectious Diseases</keyword><keyword>Sars</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epidemic Response</keyword><keyword>lessons learned</keyword><keyword>novel</keyword><keyword>outbreak Response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0950-2688</isbn><accession-num>32019614</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s0950268820000254</electronic-resource-num><notes>1469-4409

The rapidly increasing infected cases suggest its effective transmission among humans, which largely depends on virus-binding host cell receptors and host cell proteases-cleaving virus spike protein. In order to identify the virus transmission of 2019-nCoV, the protease-induced spike protein cleavage ability between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV were compared. By protein sequence aligment and structure comparison, we found the key sequence of 675-QTQTNSPRRARSVAS-679 mediating 2019-nCoV spike protein cleavage. Its furin score (0.688) was higher than that of the corresponding sequence in SARS-CoV (0.139). In addition, the fragment of 680-SPRR-683 added two arginine hydrolysis sites (R682 and R683) on the surface and formed a loop for protease recognition. The molecular docking was based on the transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS), the main proteases in coronavirus cleavage. Furthermore, as the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and cell proteases TMPRSSs are located in the same cell, the single-cell transcriptomes of normal human lung and gastroenteric system were used. The ACE2 and TMPRSSs were highly co-expressed in absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells. In conclusion, this study provides the bioinformatics evidence for the increased viral infectivity of 2019-nCoV and indicates alveolus pulmonis, intestinal epithelium and esophagus epithelium as the potential target tissues. Due to the important roles of TMPRSSs in 2019-nCoV infection, transmembrane serine protease inhibitors may be the potential antiviral treatment options for 2019-nCoV infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meng, Tong</author><author>Cao, Hao</author><author>Zhang, Hao</author><author>Kang, Zijian</author><author>Xu, Da</author><author>Gong, Haiyi</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Li, Zifu</author><author>Cui, Xingang</author><author>Xu, Huji</author><author>Wei, Haifeng</author><author>Pan, Xiuwu</author><author>Zhu, Rongrong</author><author>Xiao, Jianru</author><author>Zhou, Wang</author><author>Cheng, Liming</author><author>Liu, Jianmin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The insert sequence in SARS-CoV-2 enhances spike protein cleavage by TMPRSS</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.926006</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.926006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>At the end of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 induces an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in China1, even more spread than SARS-CoV infection2. The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ming, Wai-kit</author><author>Huang, Jian</author><author>Zhang, Casper J P</author><author>Jian Huang, Emba</author><author>Casper P Zhang, MPH J</author><author>Author affiliations, MPH</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breaking down of healthcare system: Mathematical modelling for controlling the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.27.922443</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.27.922443</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ming et al. - Unknown - Breaking down of the healthcare system Mathematical modelling for controlling the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.27.922443</url><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.27.922443.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. Methods and Findings We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented, that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved. Conclusion The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal facemask wear) aiming at obtaining overall efficacy with at least 70% to ensure the functioning of and to avoid the breakdown of health system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mizumoto, Kenji</author><author>Chowell, Gerardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the risk of 2019 Novel Coronavirus death during the course of the outbreak in China, 2020</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025163</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025163</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Since the first case of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, the number of cases continues to grow across China and multiple cases have been exported to other countries. The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were used. Results: We found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475-1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6-13.0%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.

Employing a statistical modeling analysis, we derived a delay-adjusted asymptomatic ratio of the positive 2019-nCoV infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the percentage of cases that are asymptomatic to be 34.6% (95% CrI: 29.4%-39.8%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine.

Imported cases and small transmission clusters have been reported globally. Early data suggest the virus transmits readily and a pandemic cannot be ruled out. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). We use these data to explore the effect of seasonal variation in transmissibility on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A model allowing for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters of SARS-CoV-2 spread shows how a pandemic could unfold in 2020-2022. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a peak in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in winter 2020/2021. A smaller range of parameters suggests a peak in the first half of 2020 or two peaks of similar magnitude. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted. Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Duc</author><author>Gao, Kaifu</author><author>Chen, Jiahui</author><author>Wang, Rui</author><author>Wei, Guewei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potentially highly potent drugs for 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.05.936013</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.05.936013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak a global health emergency. Currently, there is no effective anti-2019-nCoV medication. The sequence identity of the 3CL proteases of 2019-nCoV and SARS is 96%, which provides a sound foundation for structural-based drug repositioning (SBDR). Based on a SARS 3CL protease X-ray crystal structure, we construct a 3D homology structure of 2019-nCoV 3CL protease. Based on this structure and existing experimental datasets for SARS 3CL protease inhibitors, we develop an SBDR model using deep learning and mathematics to screen 1465 drugs in the DrugBank that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We found that a number of FDA approved drugs are potentially highly potent to 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Niehus, Rene</author><author>Salazar, Pablo M De</author><author>Taylor, Aimee</author><author>Lipsitch, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying bias of COVID-19 prevalence and severity estimates in Wuhan, China that depend on reported cases in international travelers</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022707</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022707</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Risk of COVID-19 infection in Wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.

All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)-the actual risk of death among all infected individuals-is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serial interval of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20019497</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20019497</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Nishiura, Linton, Akhmetzhanov - 2020 - Serial interval of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement H.N. received funding support from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development [grant number: JP18fk0108050] the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI in Japanese abbreviation) grant nos. 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, we estimate the cumulative incidence in China at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057). The most plausible number of infections is in the order of thousands, rather than hundreds, and there is a strong indication that untraced exposures other than the one in the epidemiologically linked seafood market in Wuhan have occurred.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura</author><author>Linton</author><author>Akhmetzhanov</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Initial Cluster of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infections in Wuhan, China Is Consistent with Substantial Human-to-Human Transmission</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>488</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Clin Med</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jcm9020488</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/488</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Reanalysis of the epidemic curve from the initial cluster of cases with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in December 2019 indicates substantial human-to-human transmission. It is possible that the common exposure history at a seafood market in Wuhan originated from the human-to-human transmission events within the market, and the early, strong emphasis that market exposure indicated animal-to-human transmission was potentially the result of observer bias. To support the hypothesis of zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV stemming from the Huanan seafood market, the index case should have had exposure history related to the market and the virus should have been identified from animals sold at the market.

Two mathematical SEIR models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in China. The basic reproductive number R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and 6.22 to 1.67 in entire China from 19 January to 16 February 2020. Wuhan is estimated to have reached a peak in the number of confirmed cases on 6 February 2020. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day, new symptomatic infections and COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan occurred on February 6, February 3 and February 14. The number of confirmed cases would decrease to less than 10 on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the other parts of China. Five cities with top risk index in China (except for Wuhan) are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. We should take more strict isolation measures to end the epidemic ahead of time.

Sixty-three confirmed patients were enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 ± 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 ± 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 14 (22.2%) patients had GGO, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11 (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid nodules. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients progressed, including single GGO increased, enlarged and consolidated; fibrous stripe enlarged, while solid nodules increased and enlarged. Imaging changes in novel viral pneumonia are rapid. The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Imaging changes of typical viral pneumonia and some specific imaging features were observed. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately. • High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is critical for early detection, evaluation of disease severity and follow-up of patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia. • The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse and change rapidly. • Radiologists should be aware of the various features of the disease and temporal changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paraskevis, Dimitrios</author><author>Kostaki, Evangelia Georgia</author><author>Magiorkinis, Gkikas</author><author>Panayiotakopoulos, Georgios</author><author>Sourvinos, G.</author><author>Tsiodras, Sotirios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event</title><secondary-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.26.920249</pages><volume>79</volume><keywords><keyword>Genomic sequence analysis</keyword><keyword>Molecular epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Origin</keyword><keyword>Phylogenetic analysis</keyword><keyword>Recombination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104212</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/27/2020.01.26.920249.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Sang Woo</author><author>Champredon, David</author><author>Earn, David J D</author><author>Li, Michael</author><author>Weitz, Joshua S</author><author>Grenfell, Bryan T</author><author>Dushoff, Jonathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconciling early-outbreak preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: a new framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.20019877</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Park et al. - Unknown - Reconciling early-outbreak preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty a new fram.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/03/2020.01.30.20019877.full.pdf</url><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have prioritized estimating the basic reproductive number Ro, defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case. While these efforts are extremely valuable, their modeling approaches and the resulting estimates vary widely. Here, we present a framework for comparing different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing it into three key quantities (the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation interval G, and the generation-interval dispersion kappa) and apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all three quantities, in particular in the shape of the generation-interval distribution. While rapid response during an outbreak can be valuable, avoiding over-confidence is also important. Modelers should work with field-workers to develop better methods for characterizing generation intervals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementN.A.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(dagger) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.( section sign) Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a &quot;Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,&quot; which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patino-Galindo, Juan Angel</author><author>Filip, Ioan</author><author>AlQuraishi, Mohammed</author><author>Rabadan, Raul</author><author>Patiño-Galindo, Juan Ángel</author><author>Filip, Ioan</author><author>AlQuraishi, Mohammed</author><author>Rabadan, Raul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.942748</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.942748</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Patiño-Galindo et al. - 2020 - Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD. Compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise in a region of polyprotein Orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peng, Liangrong</author><author>Yang, Wuyue</author><author>Zhang, Dongyan</author><author>Zhuge, Changjing</author><author>Hong, Liu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.16.20023465</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has attracted world- wide attention. Herein, we propose a mathematical model to analyzes this epidemic, based on a dynamic mechanism that incorporating the intrinsic impact of hidden la- tent and infectious cases on the entire process of transmission. Meanwhile, this model is validated by data correlation analysis, predicting the recent public data, and back- tracking, as well as sensitivity analysis. The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01/20 to 02/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.

Here, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze this epidemic. Based on the public data of National Health Commission of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, 2020, we reliably estimate key epidemic parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for 5 different regions. According to optimistic estimation, the epidemics in Beijing and Shanghai will end soon within two weeks, while for most part of China, including the majority of cities in Hubei province, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover, by inverse inference, we find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province and Wuhan all can be dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two days at the early stage.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pfab, Jonas</author><author>Si, Dong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DeepTracer: Predicting Backbone Atomic Structure from High Resolution Cryo-EM Density Maps of Protein Complexes</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.12.946772</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.12.946772</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Motivation: Accurately determining the atomic structure of proteins represents a fundamental prob-lem in the field of structural bioinformatics. A solution would be significant as protein structure in-formation could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient pro-tein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the tech-nology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results: We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary struc-ture information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 dif-ferent types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly im-proved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phan, Lan T</author><author>Nguyen, Thuong V.</author><author>Luong, Quang C</author><author>Nguyen, Thinh V.</author><author>Nguyen, Hieu T</author><author>Le, Hung Q</author><author>Nguyen, Thuc T</author><author>Cao, Thang M</author><author>Pham, Quang D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Importation and Human-to-Human Transmission of a Novel Coronavirus in Vietnam</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMc2001272</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Medical Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMc2001272</electronic-resource-num><notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2001272</notes><research-notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2001272</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2001272</url><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2001272</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phan, Tung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus: From discovery to clinical diagnostics</title><secondary-title>Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>104211</pages><keywords><keyword>Bat</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Netherlands</pub-location><accession-num>32007627</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104211</electronic-resource-num><notes>32007627[pmid] S1567-1348(20)30043-5[PII]</notes><research-notes>32007627[pmid] S1567-1348(20)30043-5[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007627</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pullano, G</author><author>Pinotti, F</author><author>Valdano, E</author><author>Boelle, P Y</author><author>Poletto, C</author><author>Colizza, V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) early-stage importation risk to Europe, January 2020</title><secondary-title>Euro Surveill</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro Surveill</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>4</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Europe</keyword><keyword>importation risk</keyword><keyword>travel ban</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1025-496x</isbn><accession-num>32019667</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.Es.2020.25.4.2000057</electronic-resource-num><notes>1560-7917

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted &quot;CellPhoneDB&quot; analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qian, Kai</author><author>Deng, Yi</author><author>Tai, Yonghang</author><author>Peng, Jun</author><author>Peng, Hao</author><author>Jiang, Lihong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical Characteristics of 2019 Novel Infected Coronavirus Pneumonia：A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.14.20021535</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.14.20021535</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background:A Novel pneumonia associated with the 2019 coronavirus infected pneumonia (NCIP) suddenly broke out in Wuhan, China in December 2019. 37287 confirmed cases and 813 death case in China (Until 8th/Feb/2019) have been reported in just fortnight. Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region and research scale. Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133) and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to further elaborate the clinical characteristics of NCIP, which is beneficial to the next step of prevention and treatment.

Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p&lt;0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level.

CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Quilty, Billy</author><author>Clifford, Sam</author><author>Flasche, Stefan</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effectiveness of airport screening at detecting travellers infected with 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.31.20019265</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.31.20019265</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.31.20019265.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As the number of novel coronavirus cases grows both inside and outside of China, public health authorities require evidence on the effectiveness of control measures such as thermal screening of arrivals at airports. We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.

The disease has also been exported to other countries, including the Philippines, but the level of spread is still under control (as of 08 February 2020). To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups. Here, we discuss insights that we can draw from these models, especially as inputs for designing strategies to control the epidemics.

The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with &gt; 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide (5’-aAT GGT GTT GAA GGT TTT AAT TGT TAC TTT CCT TTA CAA Tca-3’) sequence insertion, which shares homology to fish genomic sequence of Myripristis murdjan, an abundant fish type in Indo-Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Randhawa, Gurjit S</author><author>Soltysiak, Maximillian P M</author><author>El Roz, Hadi</author><author>de Souza, Camila P E</author><author>Hill, Kathleen A</author><author>Kari, Lila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.932350</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.932350</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Randhawa et al. - 2020 - Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviru.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.03.932350.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As of February 3, 2020, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread to 27 countries with 362 deaths and more than 17000 confirmed cases. 2019-nCoV is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus outbreak. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS resulted in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Mainland China alone suffered 349 deaths and 5327 confirmed cases. Though 2019-nCoV has a death rate of 2.2% as of 3 February, the 174895 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 3, 2020) are alarming. Cases are likely under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand rapid elucidation and analysis of the virus genomic sequence for timely treatment plans. We classify the 2019-nCoV using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, alignment-free methods that use Machine Learning (ML) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for genome analyses. Genomic sequences were mapped into their respective genomic signals (discrete numeric series) using a two-dimensional numerical representation (Chaos Game Representation). The magnitude spectra were computed by applying Discrete Fourier Transform on the genomic signals. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to calculate a pairwise distance matrix. The feature vectors were constructed from the distance matrix and used as an input to the supervised machine learning algorithms. 10-fold cross-validation was applied to compute the average classification accuracy scores. The trained classifier models were used to predict the labels of 29 2019-nCoV sequences. The classification strategy used over 5000 genomes and tested associations at taxonomic levels of realm to species. From our machine learning-based alignment-free analyses using MLDSP-GUI, we corroborate the current hypothesis of a bat origin and classify 2019-nCoV as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Read, Jonathan M</author><author>Bridgen, Jessica RE E</author><author>Cummings, Derek AT T</author><author>Ho, Antonia</author><author>Jewell, Chris P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.23.20018549</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/24/2020.01.23.20018549.full.pdf</url><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan, China. The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJMR acknowledges support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/N014499/1) and the Medical Research Council (MR/S004793/1).

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4—3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J</author><author>Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine</author><author>Balbin-Ramon, Graciela Josefina</author><author>Rabaan, Ali A</author><author>Sah, Ranjit</author><author>Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto</author><author>Pagliano, Pasquale</author><author>Esposito, Silvano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>History is repeating itself, a probable zoonotic spillover as a cause of an epidemic: the case of 2019 novel Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Le infezioni in medicina</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Le infezioni in medicina</full-title></periodical><pages>3-5</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Italy</pub-location><accession-num>32009128</accession-num><notes>32009128[pmid]</notes><research-notes>32009128[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009128</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pathogen transmission from a vertebrate animal to a human, also known as zoonotic spillover, represents a global public health burden, which while associated with multiple outbreaks, still remains a poorly understood phenomenon. Coronaviruses, like influenza viruses, circulate in nature in various animal species. Alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses can infect mammals and gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses tend to infect birds, but some of them can also be transmitted to mammals. Although still preliminary, current data suggest that bats are the most probable initial source of the current 2019 novel CoV (2019nCoV) outbreak, that begun on December 2019 in Wuhan, China, apparently spreading from a &quot;wet market&quot; to multiple cities and provinces in China. This epidemic of 2019nCoV, already reaching more than 6,000 cases to-day (end of January 2020) (&gt;90% in China), will not be the last one linked to zoonotic spillover events.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ronco, Claudio</author><author>Navalesi, Paolo</author><author>Vincent, Jean Louis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coronavirus epidemic: preparing for extracorporeal organ support in intensive care</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30060-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213260020300606</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roosa, K.</author><author>Lee, Y.</author><author>Luo, R.</author><author>Kirpich, A.</author><author>Rothenberg, R.</author><author>Hyman, J.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We provide timely short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 - 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). Our forecasts suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Russell, Clark D</author><author>Millar, Jonathan E</author><author>Baillie, J Kenneth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical evidence does not support corticosteroid treatment for 2019-nCoV lung injury</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30317-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620303172</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. The clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterised, little data are available that describe the disease pathogenesis, and no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist. Corticosteroids were widely used during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, 2 and are being used in patients with 2019-nCoV in addition to other therapeutics. 3 However, current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected (released Jan 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 4 Understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in 2019-nCoV is of immediate clinical importance. Here we discuss the clinical outcomes of corticosteroid use in coronavirus and similar outbreaks (table). Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are partly caused by host immune responses. Corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation but also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. In SARS-CoV infection, as with influenza, systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. 12 In SARS, inflammation persists after viral clearance. 13,14 Pulmonary histology in both SARS and MERS infections reveals inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage, 15 with one report suggesting haemophagocytosis. 16 Theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role to suppress lung inflammation. In a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, 2 almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were given corticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalent dose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25, prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). Patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. After statistical adjustment for immortal time and indication biases, the authors concluded that administration of corticosteroids was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0·8, 95% CI 0·5-1·1; p=0·12) but was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazard ratio 0·4, 95% CI 0·2-0·7; p=0·0005). However, these effect estimates have a high risk of error due to the probable presence of unmeasured confounders. In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with SARS, only four studies provided conclusive data, all indicating harm. 1 The first was a case-control study of SARS patients with (n=15) and without (n=30) SARS-related psychosis; all were given corticosteroid treatment, but those who developed psychosis were given a higher cumulative dose than those who did not (10 975 mg hydrocortisone equivalent vs 6780 mg; p=0·017). 6 The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with SARS who were not critically ill; the nine patients who were given hydrocortisone (mean 4·8 days [95% CI 4·1-5·5] since fever onset) had greater viraemia in the second and third weeks after infection than those who were given 0·9% saline control. 5 The Outcomes of corticosteroid therapy* Comment MERS-CoV Delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract 2 Adjusted hazard ratio 0·4 (95% CI 0·2-0·7) SARS-CoV Delayed clearance of viral RNA from blood 5 Significant difference but effect size not quantified SARS-CoV Complication: psychosis 6 Associated with higher cumulative dose, 10 975 mg vs 6780 mg hydrocortisone equivalent SARS-CoV Complication: diabetes 7 33 (35%) of 95 patients treated with corticosteroid developed corticosteroid-induced diabetes SARS-CoV Complication: avascular necrosis in survivors 8 Among 40 patients who survived after corticosteroid treatment, 12 (30%) had avascular necrosis and 30 (75%) had osteoporosis Influenza Increased mortality 9 Risk ratio for mortality 1·75 (95% CI 1·3-2·4) in a meta-analysis of 6548 patients from ten studies RSV No clinical benefit in children 10,11 No effect in largest randomised controlled trial of 600 children, of whom 305 (51%) had been treated with corticosteroids CoV=coronavirus.

DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs—MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryu, Sukhyun</author><author>Ali, Sheikh Taslim</author><author>Lim, Jun-sik</author><author>Chun, Byung Chul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The estimate of infected individuals of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus in South Korea by incoming international students from the countries of risk of 2019-Novel Coronavirus: a simulation study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.15.20023234</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.15.20023234</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Overall, 37000 international students from the country of risk of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) will arrive in South Korea. The individuals from the country of risk of COVID-19 are included a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. To estimate the possible number of infected individuals due to the large influx of international students, the deterministic compartment was modeled by different compliance of home-quarantine. Our findings, under the strict compliance of quarantine for the incoming international students, indicate it is less likely to occur epidemics in South Korea. To mitigate possible epidemics, considerable public health resources with high compliance of quarantine are needed.

Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection efficiency for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify country likely detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.

Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

To date, there is no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the 2019-nCoV using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this nasty virus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwartz</author><author>Graham</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from (Wuhan) Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title></periodical><pages>194</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>2019</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>CoV</keyword><keyword>MERS</keyword><keyword>Middle East respiratory syndrome</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Wuhan coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Wuhan coronavirus outbreak</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>emerging infection</keyword><keyword>epidemic</keyword><keyword>maternal death</keyword><keyword>maternal morbidity</keyword><keyword>maternal mortality</keyword><keyword>nCoV</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>pregnancy</keyword><keyword>pregnancy complications</keyword><keyword>severe acute respiratory syndrome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v12020194</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/2/194</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People’s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants.

We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.

Based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cured cases published daily by government, we effectively simulate and predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19 in different regions in China. Meanwhile, the model reveals the growth rate of the epidemic, through which the basic reproductive number is thus estimated to be 3.25 to 3.4. Then, we apply the model to track the spread of COVID-19 in Japan. We find that the trend of the epidemic in Japan is strikingly similar to that in Wuhan, China at the early stage. Therefore there are reasons to draw a serious concern that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective control measures are carried out immediately. Finally, we make a prediction of the future trend of COVID-19 in Japan, and suggest an enhancement of control measures as soon as possible, so as to avoid a severe outbreak

In the early stage, people knows little about the 2019-nCoV virus was not clear, and the spread period was encountering China’s annual spring migration, which made the epidemic spread rapidly from Wuhan to almost all provinces in China.Methods This study builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions, revealing the effects of three measures on controlling the spread of the epidemic.Based on MATLAB R2017a, computational experiments were performed to simulate the epidemic prevention and control measures.Findings The research results show that current prevention and control measures in China are very necessary. This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (E-status).Interpretation The results of this study are applicable to explore the impact of the implementation of relevant measures on the prevention and control of epidemic spread, and to identify key individuals that may exist during the spread of the epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>She, Jun</author><author>Jiang, Jinjun</author><author>Ye, Ling</author><author>Hu, Lijuan</author><author>Bai, Chunxue</author><author>Song, Yuanlin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019 novel coronavirus of pneumonia in Wuhan, China: emerging attack and management strategies</title><secondary-title>Clinical and Translational Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical and Translational Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>19</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Medicine/Public Health</keyword><keyword>general</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>SpringerOpen</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40169-020-00271-z</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://clintransmed.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40169-020-00271-z</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An ongoing outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019. With the spread of the new coronavirus accelerating, person-to-person transmission in family homes or hospitals, and intercity spread of 2019-nCoV occurred. At least 40,261 cases confirmed, 23,589 cases suspected, 909 cases death and 3444 cases cured in China and worldwide 24 countries confirmed 383 cases being diagnosed, 1 case death in February 10th, 2020. At present, the mortality of 2019-nCoV in China is 2.3%, compared with 9.6% of SARS and 34.4% of MERS reported by WHO. It seems the new virus is not as fatal as many people thought. Chinese authorities improved surveillance network, made the laboratory be able to recognize the outbreak within a few weeks and announced the virus genome that provide efficient epidemiological control. More comprehensive information is required to understand 2019-nCoV feature, the epidemiology of origin and spreading, and the clinical phenomina. According to the current status, blocking transmission, isolation, protection, and alternative medication are the urgent management strategies against 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shen, Kunling</author><author>Yang, Yonghong</author><author>Wang, Tianyou</author><author>Zhao, Dongchi</author><author>Jiang, Yi</author><author>Jin, Runming</author><author>Zheng, Yuejie</author><author>Xu, Baoping</author><author>Xie, Zhengde</author><author>Lin, Likai</author><author>Shang, Yunxiao</author><author>Lu, Xiaoxia</author><author>Shu, Sainan</author><author>Bai, Yan</author><author>Deng, Jikui</author><author>Lu, Min</author><author>Ye, Leping</author><author>Wang, Xuefeng</author><author>Wang, Yongyan</author><author>Gao, Liwei</author><author>Diseases, China National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory</author><author>National Center for Children’s Health  China, Beijing</author><author>Group of Respirology  Chinese Medical Association, Chinese Pediatric Society</author><author>Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Doctor Association Committee on Respirology</author><author>Pediatrics, China Medicine Education Association Committee on</author><author>Pediatrics, Chinese Research Hospital Association Committee on</author><author>Pediatrics, Chinese Non-government Medical Institutions Association Committee on</author><author>China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Committee on Children’s Health and Medicine Research</author><author>China News of Drug Information Association, Committee on Children’s Safety Medication</author><author>Alliance, Global Pediatric Pulmonology</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children: experts' consensus statement</title><secondary-title>World journal of pediatrics : WJP</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World journal of pediatrics : WJP</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Switzerland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12519-020-00343-7</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32034659</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Since the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, China, by January 30, 2020, a total of 9692 confirmed cases and 15,238 suspected cases have been reported around 31 provinces or cities in China.

The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation.

Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.

Purpose To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans. Materials and Methods Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women, 16-76 years old) with 2019-nCoV pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated. Results Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of the endemic center Wuhan contact. Fever (49/51, 96%) and cough (24/51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37/51, 73%), neutrophil count (44/51, 86.3%) and normal (17/51, 35.3%) or reduced (33/51, 64.7%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground grass opacity (GGO) in 39/51 (77%) patients, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38/51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30/51 (59%) and pure consolidation in 28/51 (55%) patients. 44/51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41/51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44/51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 or more days from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 or fewer days (431/712 lesions vs. 129/612 lesions, p &lt; 0.001). Patients more than 50 years old had more consolidated lung lesions than those 50 years or younger (212/470 vs. 198/854, p &lt; 0.001). Follow up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in 7 (54%) patients and progression in 4 (31%) patients. Conclusions Patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground grass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure are highly suspected of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spencer, Julie A</author><author>Shutt, Deborah P</author><author>Moser, Sarah K</author><author>Clegg, Hannah</author><author>Wearing, Helen J</author><author>Mukundan, Harshini</author><author>Manore, Carrie A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological parameter review and comparative dynamics of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and adenovirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.04.20020404</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.04.20020404</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.04.20020404.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Influenza-like illness (ILI) accounts for a large burden of annual morbidity and mortality worldwide. A finer-grained knowledge of the parameters and dynamics of the viruses commonly underlying ILI is needed for modeling, diagnostic, and intervention efforts. We conducted an extensive literature review for epidemiological parameter values for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV), and adenovirus. We also developed a deterministic SEIR model for ILI, and derived an expression for R0. We here report ranges and means for parameters for these five common viruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch support provided by the U.S. Department of Energy through the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

This short communication gives a brief introduction on how the demand for information on this new epidemic is reported through Google Trends. Author draw conclusions on current infodemiological data on 2019-nCov using three main search queries: coronavirus, SARS and MERS. Two approaches are set. First is worldwide perspective, second is Chinese perspective.

This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Subspecialty Group of Gastroenterology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Prevention and control program on 2019 novel coronavirus infection in Children's digestive endoscopy center].</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>E003</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0578-1310 (Print) 0578-1310</isbn><accession-num>32023683</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2020.0003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Subspecialty Group of Gastroenterology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.

Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.

Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the in house research program of the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Biao</author><author>Wang, Xia</author><author>Li, Qian</author><author>Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi</author><author>Tang, Sanyi</author><author>Xiao, Yanni</author><author>Wu, Jianhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of the transmission risk of 2019-nCov and its implication for public health interventions</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3525558</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Keke</author><author>Huang, Yining</author><author>Chen, Meilian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel Coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) epidemic scale estimation: topological network-based infection dynamic model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20023572</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20023572</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Covid-19) hit Wuhan and hundreds of cities, 29 territories in global. We present a method for scale estimation in dynamic while most of the researchers used static parameters. Methods: We used historical data and SEIR model for important parameters assumption. And according to the timeline, we used dynamic parameters for infection topology network building. Also, the migration data was used for the Non-Wuhan area estimation which can be cross-validation for the Wuhan model. All data were from the public. Results: The estimated number of infections was 61,596 (95%CI: 58,344.02-64,847.98) by 25 Jan in Wuhan. And the estimation number of the imported cases from Wuhan of Guangzhou was 170 (95%CI: 161.27-179.26), infection scale in Guangzhou was 315 (95%CI: 109.20-520.79), while the imported cases were 168 and the scale of the infection was 339 published by the authority. Conclusions: dynamic network model and dynamic parameter for the different time periods is an effective way for infection scale modeling.

Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-2 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team</author><author>Li, Qun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Notes from the Field An Outbreak of NCIP ( 2019-nCoV ) Infection in China — Wuhan , Hubei Province , 2019 − 2020</title><secondary-title>China CDC Weekly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>China CDC Weekly</full-title></periodical><pages>79-80</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://An+Outbreak+of+NCIP+(2019-nCoV)+Infection+in+China+—+Wuhan,+Hubei+Province,+2019−2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The, Lancet</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emerging understandings of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30186-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30186-0</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thevarajan, Irani</author><author>Nguyen, Thi Ho</author><author>Koutsakos, Marios</author><author>Druce, Julian</author><author>Caly, Leon</author><author>Sandt, Carolien E van de</author><author>Jia, Xiaoxiao</author><author>Nicholson, Suellen</author><author>Catton, Mike</author><author>Cowie, Benjamin</author><author>Tong, Steven</author><author>Lewin, Sharon</author><author>Kedzierska, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breadth of concomitant immune responses underpinning viral clearance and patient recovery in a non-severe case of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025841</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025841</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>We report the kinetics of the immune response in relation to clinical and virological features of a patient with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) requiring hospitalisation.

Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005.

This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a global pandemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, H Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[2019-nCoV: new challenges from coronavirus]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Public health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0253-9624 (Print)0253-9624</isbn><accession-num>32023682</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tian, H Y

The virus belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Huaiyu</author><author>Li, Yidan</author><author>Liu, Yonghong</author><author>Kraemer, Moritz U.

On January 23rd 2020 China shut down transit in and out of Wuhan, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million inhabitants, to contain the outbreak. By combining epidemiological and human mobility data we find that the travel ban slowed the dispersal of nCoV from Wuhan to other cities in China by 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29). This delay provided time to establish and reinforce other control measures that are essential to halt the epidemic. The ongoing dissemination of 2019-nCoV provides an opportunity to examine how travel restrictions impede the spatial dispersal of an emerging infectious disease. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement Funding for this study was provided by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ18025); Beijing Advanced Innovation Program for Land Surface Science; National Natural Science Foundation of China (81673234); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS)(2018QNRC001) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Xiaolong</author><author>Li, Cheng</author><author>Huang, Ailing</author><author>Xia, Shuai</author><author>Lu, Sicong</author><author>Shi, Zhengli</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Jiang, Shibo</author><author>Yang, Zhenlin</author><author>Wu, Yanling</author><author>Ying, Tianlei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody</title><secondary-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</full-title></periodical><pages>382-385</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>ACE2</keyword><keyword>RBD</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV</keyword><keyword>monoclonal antibody</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>ABSTRACTThe newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.

The critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. It has been recently known that the 2019-nCoV shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on SARS which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). Here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. Together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-nCov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality.

By analysing 53 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences collected up to February 3, 2020, we find a strong association between the time of sample collection and accumulation of genetic diversity. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods indicate that the virus was introduced into the human population in early December and has an epidemic doubling time of approximately seven days. Phylodynamic modelling provides an estimate of epidemic size through time. Precise estimates of epidemic size are not possible with current genetic data, but our analyses indicate evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections caused by each case, as indicated by a high level of over-dispersion in the reproduction number. Larger numbers of more systematically sampled sequences-particularly from across China-will allow phylogenetic estimates of epidemic size and growth rate to be substantially refined.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wahba, Lamia</author><author>Jain, Nimit</author><author>Fire, Andrew Z</author><author>Shoura, Massa J</author><author>Artiles, Karen L</author><author>McCoy, Matthew J</author><author>Jeong, Dae Eun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of a pangolin niche for a 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus through an extensive meta-metagenomic search</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.939660</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.939660</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>In numerous instances, tracking the biological significance of a nucleic acid sequence can be augmented through the identification of environmental niches in which the sequence of interest is present.

Zhou et al. 2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7), we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al. (Viruses 11:11, 2019, http://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979). Our observations are relevant to discussions of the derivation of 2019-nCoV and illustrate the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid sequences.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walls, Alexandra C</author><author>Park, Young-Jun</author><author>Tortorici, M.

Coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein trimers promote entry into cells and are the main target of the humoral immune response. We show here that SARS-CoV-2 S mediates entry in VeroE6 cells and in BHK cells transiently transfected with human ACE2, establishing ACE2 as a functional receptor for this novel coronavirus. We further demonstrate that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, which correlates with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein harbors a furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1/S2 subunits, which is processed during biogenesis and sets this virus apart from SARS-CoV and other SARS-related CoVs. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer, demonstrating spontaneous opening of the receptor-binding domain, and providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry. Finally, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV S murine polyclonal sera potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry into target cells, thereby indicating that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes can be elicited upon vaccination.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wan, Suxin</author><author>Yi, Qingjie</author><author>Fan, Shibing</author><author>Lv, Jinglong</author><author>Zhang, Xianxiang</author><author>Guo, Lian</author><author>Lang, Chunhui</author><author>Xiao, Qing</author><author>Xiao, Kaihu</author><author>Yi, Zhengjun</author><author>Qiang, Mao</author><author>Xiang, Jianglin</author><author>Zhang, Bangshuo</author><author>Chen, Yongping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood of 123 hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.20021832</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.20021832</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: To explore the cellular immunity and cytokines status of NCP patients and to predict the correlation between the cellular immunity levels, cytokines and the severity of patients. Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10. Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm the &quot;warning value&quot; of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Huwen</author><author>Wang, Zezhou</author><author>Dong, Yinqiao</author><author>Chang, Ruijie</author><author>Xu, Chen</author><author>Yu, Xiaoyue</author><author>Zhang, Shuxian</author><author>Tsamlag, Lhakpa</author><author>Shang, Meili</author><author>Huang, Jinyan</author><author>Wang, Ying</author><author>Xu, Gang</author><author>Shen, Tian</author><author>Zhang, Xinxin</author><author>Cai, Yong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phase adjusted estimation of the number of 2019 novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.18.20024281</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.18.20024281</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>An outbreak of clusters of viral pneumonia due to a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV / SARS-CoV-2) happened in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China in December 2019. Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe National Natural Science Foundation of China (91742109, 31770978, 31722003, 31770925, 31370847, 81770552), National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0900102), National Science and Technology Major Project (2018ZX10302205), Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Research in Structural Birth Defect Disease (2019B030301004), Guangzhou Women and Children s Medical Center Fund (5001-3001032) and National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1037321, 1105209, 1143976, and 1080321 to A.L.) funded this study.

This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF. Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients.

Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods: We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings: Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No founding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Pathogenic laboratory testing is the diagnostic gold standard but it is time consuming with significant false positive results. Fast and accurate diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods：We collected 453 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the Inception migration-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. Findings: The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 82.9% with specificity of 80.5% and sensitivity of 84%. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 73.1% with specificity of 67% and sensitivity of 74%. Interpretation: These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis. Funding: No funding is involved in the execution of the project. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 20 Feb 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 20 Feb 2020, totally 75,570 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 8.71% (95% CI: 7.95%-9.64%) in Hubei province, including Wuhan, the epicenter, and 1.21% (95% CI: 1.07%-1.40%) in other areas of China, respectively. We observed obvious decreasing trends of CFR for COVID-19, with three distinct turning points on January 30, February 6, and February 14 for Hubei province, and one turning point on February 7 for other areas, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 7 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding was received for the research reported in the article. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Existing evidence have confirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medical staffs. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupational protection code in battling this novel contagious disease. The risk of 2019-nCoV infection was higher in the open area than in the quarantined area. N95 may be more effective for 2019-nCoV infections.

According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zhenwei</author><author>Chen, Xiaorong</author><author>Lu, Yunfei</author><author>Chen, Feifei</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia receiving combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment</title><secondary-title>BioScience Trends</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioScience Trends</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5582/bst.2020.01030</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.biosciencetrends.com</url><url>https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/advpub/0/advpub_2020.01030/_article</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wassenaar, Trudy M.</author><author>Zou, Ying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019_nCoV: Rapid classification of betacoronaviruses and identification of traditional Chinese medicine as potential origin of zoonotic coronaviruses</title><secondary-title>Letters in Applied Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Letters in Applied Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>lam.13285</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Lett Appl Microbiol</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/lam.13285</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lam.13285</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watanabe, Yasunori</author><author>Berndsen, Zachary T.</author><author>Raghwani, Jayna</author><author>Seabright, Gemma E.</author><author>Allen, Joel D.</author><author>McLellan, Jason S</author><author>Wilson, Ian A.</author><author>Bowden, Thomas A.</author><author>Ward, Andrew B.</author><author>Crispin, Max</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vulnerabilities in coronavirus glycan shields despite extensive glycosylation</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.957472</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.957472</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Qiang</author><author>Wang, Yanhai</author><author>Ma, Juncai</author><author>Han, Jun</author><author>Jiang, Mengnan</author><author>Zhao, Li</author><author>Ye, Fei</author><author>Song, Jingdong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Notes from the Field Description of the First Strain of 2019-nCoV , C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan Strain — National Pathogen Resource Center , China , 2020</title><secondary-title>China CDC Weekly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>China CDC Weekly</full-title></periodical><pages>81-82</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Description+of+the+First+Strain+of+2019-nCoV,+C-Tan-nCoV+Wuhan+Strain+—+National+Pathogen+Resource+Center,+China,+2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e3a460f1-661b-4180-b562-ecd8e9502082</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilder-Smith, A</author><author>Freedman, D O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment: pivotal role for old-style public health measures in the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Travel Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Travel Medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>community</keyword><keyword>containment</keyword><keyword>disease outbreaks</keyword><keyword>middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus</keyword><keyword>novel coronavirus 2019</keyword><keyword>pandemics</keyword><keyword>public health medicine</keyword><keyword>quarantine</keyword><keyword>severe acute respiratory syndrome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jtm/taaa020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa020/5735321</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, Nick</author><author>Kvalsvig, Amanda</author><author>Barnard, Lucy Telfar</author><author>Baker, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the Case Fatality Risk of COVID-19 using Cases from Outside China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.15.20023499</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.15.20023499</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>There is large uncertainty around the case fatality risk (CFR) for COVID-19 in China. Therefore, we considered symptomatic cases outside of China (countries/settings with 20+ cases) and the proportion who are in intensive care units (4.0%, 14/349 on 13 February 2020). Given what is known about CFRs for ICU patients with severe respiratory conditions from a meta-analysis, we estimated a CFR of 1.37% (95%CI: 0.57% to 3.22%) for COVID-19 cases outside of China.

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019.

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The cryo-EM structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Aiping</author><author>Peng, Yousong</author><author>Huang, Baoying</author><author>Ding, Xiao</author><author>Wang, Xianyue</author><author>Niu, Peihua</author><author>Meng, Jing</author><author>Zhu, Zhaozhong</author><author>Zhang, Zheng</author><author>Wang, Jiangyuan</author><author>Sheng, Jie</author><author>Quan, Lijun</author><author>Xia, Zanxian</author><author>Tan, Wenjie</author><author>Cheng, Genhong</author><author>Jiang, Taijiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China</title><secondary-title>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chom.2020.02.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S193131282030072X</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Chao</author><author>Zheng, Shufa</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Zheng, Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20022228</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Wu et al. - 2020 - Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the grants from the National Key Programs for Infectious Diseases of China (2017ZX10103008). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing4 identified a novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV).Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination.

This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Huailiang</author><author>Huang, Jian</author><author>Zhang, Casper JP</author><author>He, Zonglin</author><author>Ming, Wai-kit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Facemask shortage and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak: Reflection on public health measures</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20020735</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Wu et al. - 2020 - Facemask shortage and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak Reflection on public health measures.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak in China. We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.

While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential fecal-oral transmission route.

The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Shu-Yuan</author><author>Wu, Yingjie</author><author>Liu, Huan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolving status of the 2019 novel coronavirus Infection: proposal of conventional serologic assays for disease diagnosis and infection monitoring [Commentary/Review]</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1002/jmv.25702</pages><keywords><keyword>antibody</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>nCoV-2019</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>serologic assay</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25702</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031264</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) outbreak in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly nationwide, with some cases occurring in other parts of the world. Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error.

Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xie, Xingzhi</author><author>Zhong, Zheng</author><author>Zhao, Wei</author><author>Zheng, Chao</author><author>Wang, Fei</author><author>Liu, Jun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chest CT for Typical 2019-nCoV Pneumonia: Relationship to Negative RT-PCR Testing</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200343</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher> Radiological Society of North America </publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200343</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200343</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Some patients with positive chest CT findings may present with negative results of real time reverse-transcription–polymerase chain- reaction (RT-PCR) for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.Methods We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.Results An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10−2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10−4 to 2.72 × 10−2) for N, 5.34 × 10−3 (5.10 × 10−4, 1.28 × 10−2) for S, 1.69 × 10−3 (3.94 × 10−4, 3.60 × 10−3) for P, 1.65 × 10−3 (4.47 × 10−4, 3.24 × 10−3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.Conclusion Our analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.CoVsCoronaviruses2019-nCoV2019-novel coronavirusSARS-CoVsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusCDScoding sequencetMRCAthe most recent common ancestorGISAIDthe Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza DatabaseESSsEffective sample sizes</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiong, Hao</author><author>Yan, Huili</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.20021519</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.

Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.

Design Retrospective case series.

Setting Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.

Participants 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.

Main outcome measures Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.

Results Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.

Conclusion As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Xiaowei</author><author>Jiang, Xiangao</author><author>Ma, Chunlian</author><author>Du, Peng</author><author>Li, Xukun</author><author>Lv, Shuangzhi</author><author>Yu, Liang</author><author>Chen, Yanfei</author><author>Su, Junwei</author><author>Lang, Guanjing</author><author>Li, Yongtao</author><author>Zhao, Hong</author><author>Xu, Kaijin</author><author>Ruan, Lingxiang</author><author>Wu, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep Learning System to Screen Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09334</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We found that the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab has a relatively low positive rate in the early stage to determine COVID-19 (named by the World Health Organization). The manifestations of computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 had their own characteristics, which are different from other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia. Therefore, clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a 3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Xintian</author><author>Chen, Ping</author><author>Wang, Jingfang</author><author>Feng, Jiannan</author><author>Zhou, Hui</author><author>Li, Xuan</author><author>Zhong, Wu</author><author>Hao, Pei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission</title><secondary-title>Science China Life Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China Life Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>China</pub-location><accession-num>32009228</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>32009228[pmid] 10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5[PII]</notes><research-notes>32009228[pmid] 10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009228</url><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Zhijian</author><author>Peng, Cheng</author><author>Shi, Yulong</author><author>Zhu, Zhengdan</author><author>Mu, Kaijie</author><author>Wang, Xiaoyu</author><author>Zhu, Weiliang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nelfinavir was predicted to be a potential inhibitor of 2019-nCov main protease by an integrative approach combining homology modelling, molecular docking and binding free energy calculation</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.27.921627</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.27.921627</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.27.921627.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>2019-nCov has caused more than 80 deaths as of 27 January 2020 in China, and infection cases have been reported in more than 10 countries.

We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of −24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and −9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that nelfinavir might be a potential inhibitor against 2019-nCov Mpro.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, Renhong</author><author>Zhang, Yuanyuan</author><author>Guo, Yingying</author><author>Xia, Lu</author><author>Zhou, Qiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structural basis for the recognition of the 2019-nCoV by human ACE2</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.956946</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.956946</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be the cellular receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that is causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter BAT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å in the presence of BAT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 Å, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, F</author><author>Liu, N</author><author>Wu, J Y</author><author>Hu, L L</author><author>Su, G S</author><author>Zheng, N S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Pulmonary rehabilitation guidelines in the principle of 4S for patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E004</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Antiviral therapy</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1001-0939 (Print)1001-0939</isbn><accession-num>32023687</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yang, F

Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected ≥ 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP. Funding National Science and Technology Major Project, Sanming Project of Medicine and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.

As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

[Methods] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, Analysis of 66,492 confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland. [Results] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 54,406 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 37,914 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline. From February 3, 2020, except for Hubei Province, In China mainland, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP has continued to decline; From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 1,523 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, a cumulative cure of 8096 cases, and mortality and cure rate were 2.29% (1523/66492) and 12.18% (8096/66492) respectively; Starting from January 27, 2020, The spread index of NCP gradually declined, and the extinction index of NCP rose little by little from January 29, 2020. [Conclusion] Starting from February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of the NCP is gradually decrease in China mainland. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved. Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time. However, the turning point of the epidemic in mainland China has not yet occurred. On February 12, 2020, the turning point of the epidemic in China mainland except Hubei province, has turned up.

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.

The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe thank for funding supports from City University of Hong Kong (#7200573 and #9610416).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction researches of the 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhai, Yunkai</author><author>Wang, Yichuan</author><author>Zhang, Minhao</author><author>Gittell, Jody Hoffer</author><author>Jiang, Shuai</author><author>Chen, Baozhan</author><author>Cui, Fangfang</author><author>He, Xianying</author><author>Zhao, Jie</author><author>Wang, Xiaojun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From Isolation to Coordination: How Can Telemedicine Help Combat the COVID-19 Outbreak?</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025957</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025957</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training.

Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China are collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Historical data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source are used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimization procedure is used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the coming weeks. Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.

Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.

The same as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2019-nCov enters into host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In order to dissect the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion and explore a potential route of the 2019-nCov infection in digestive system infection, 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed. The data showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. These results indicated along with respiratory systems, digestive system is a potential routes for 2019-nCov infection. In conclusion, this study has provided the bioinformatics evidence of the potential route for infection of 2019-nCov in digestive system along with respiratory tract and may have significant impact for our healthy policy setting regards to prevention of 2019-nCoV infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Jin‐jin</author><author>Dong, Xiang</author><author>Cao, Yi‐Yuan</author><author>Yuan, Ya‐dong</author><author>Yang, Yi‐bin</author><author>Yan, You‐qin</author><author>Akdis, Cezmi A.</author><author>Gao, Ya‐dong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>Allergy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Allergy</full-title></periodical><pages>all.14238</pages><keywords><keyword>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus‐2</keyword><keyword>allergy</keyword><keyword>coronavirus disease 2019</keyword><keyword>eosinophil</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/all.14238</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/all.14238</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Juanjuan</author><author>Litvinova, Maria</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Wang, Yan</author><author>Deng, Xiaowei</author><author>Chen, Xinghui</author><author>Li, Mei</author><author>Zheng, Wen</author><author>Yi, Lan</author><author>Chen, Xinhua</author><author>Wu, Qianhui</author><author>Liang, Yuxia</author><author>Wang, Xiling</author><author>Yang, Juan</author><author>Sun, Kaiyuan</author><author>Longini, Ira M.</author><author>Halloran, M.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested.

No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC50 of 1.66 μM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Junyi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testing Case Number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China with Newcomb-Benford Law</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05695</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 bursted out about two months ago in Wuhan has caused the death of more than a thousand people.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. This article is protected by copyright.

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)，TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.

Methods The information of NCIP and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 287 confirmed NCIP patients obtained from the website of health committees of 16 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the NCIP epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed NCIP case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of NCIP were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 287 confirmed NCIP cases aged 9 months to 90 years and the average age was (42.38 ±15.97) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.35: 1. The numbers of NCIP patients in Wuhan and other inland areas were in line with Y=0.7209 x3-11.97x2+59.129x (R2=0.9858) and Y=2.2169 x3-39.74x2+158.88x (R2=0.9357)，respectively, with good fitting effects judging by their R2 values. Conclusions The fatality rate of NCIP is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of NCIP patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (68.29%).

The model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period, hospitalization time, non-hospitalization daily mortality, non-hospitalization daily recovery rate, and hospitalization proportion, etc. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated the total cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. The total cumulative cases significantly decreased with decline of transmission strength and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate. In a certain range, the total cumulative cases significantly increased with mean incubation period. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that dynamic change of transmission strength is one of the most important and controllable factors. In addition, reducing the delay for hospitalization is much effective in weakening disease epidemic. Non-hospitalization recovery rate is of importance for enhancing immunity to recover from the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Zhigang</author><author>Wu, Qunfu</author><author>Zhang, Tao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pangolin homology associated with 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.950253</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.950253</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>To explore potential intermediate host of a novel coronavirus is vital to rapidly control continuous COVID-19 spread. We found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus (named as Pangolin-CoV) from dead Malayan Pangolins. Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13. It indicates Pangolin-CoV has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-nCoV, and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Hongxin</author><author>Man, Sailimai</author><author>Wang, Bo</author><author>Ning, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemic size of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia in the Epicenter Wuhan: using data of five-countries' evacuation action</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.12.20022285</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.12.20022285</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Since late December 2019, novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCP) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan. Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.

The new virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.

This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, Yishan</author><author>Huang, Zhen</author><author>Ying, Guoping</author><author>Zhang, Xia</author><author>Ye, Wei</author><author>Hu, Zhiliang</author><author>Hu, Chunmei</author><author>Wei, Hongxia</author><author>Zeng, Yi</author><author>Chi, Yun</author><author>Cheng, Cong</author><author>Lin, Feishen</author><author>Lu, Hu</author><author>Xiao, Lingyan</author><author>Song, Yan</author><author>Wang, Chunming</author><author>Yi, Yongxiang</author><author>Dong, Lei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative study of the lymphocyte change between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases suggesting uncontrolled inflammation might not be the main reason of tissue injury</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20024885</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20024885</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread across China and to the globe. This virus shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining unclear. Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation distribution in the samples of COVID-19 infected patients, and compare the data with those from the pneumonia cases not caused by COVID-19. The study enrolled 125 patients, comprising 103 COVID-19-infected patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Blood was collected for lymphocyte subsets and cytokines determination by flow cytometry analysis. The differences in biochemical indices and lymphocyte subsets distribution between COVID-19-infected and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes relating to organ injury in COVID-19 infected patients (exclude asymptomatic infected cases). Results: We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19-infected and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The present study indicates significantly different clinical features between COVID-19-caused and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (&quot;cytokine storm&quot;). These findings provide new insights for developing efficient therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection.

Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding was received for this study. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 ± 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 ± 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 ± 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement no funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. BAT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with BAT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-BAT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. The extended TM7 in each BAT1 clamps CLD of ACE2. Structural analysis suggests that the ACE2-BAT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Tao</author><author>Liu, Quanhui</author><author>Yang, Zimo</author><author>Liao, Jingyi</author><author>Yang, Kexin</author><author>Bai, Wei</author><author>6#, Lu</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Biomedical, West China</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.10530</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.10530</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</keyword><keyword>basic reproduction number</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Objectives: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Methods: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. Using a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0]. Conclusions: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Yadi</author><author>Hou, Yuan</author><author>Shen, Jiayu</author><author>Huang, Yin</author><author>Martin, William</author><author>Cheng, Feixiong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20020263</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.03.20020263.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNAAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.

Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was reported at December 2019 (2019-nCoV) in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS). Up to 9th of February 2020, at least 37, 251 cases have been reported with 812 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4+, T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology. Therefore, we suggest that monoclonal antibody that targets the GM-CSF or interleukin 6 receptor may potentially curb immunopathology caused by 2019-nCoV and consequently win more time for virus clearance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Yunyun</author><author>Zeng, Yuyang</author><author>Tong, Yongqing</author><author>Chen, ChangZheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ophthalmologic evidence against the interpersonal transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus through conjunctiva</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20021956</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background: The emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019−nCoV) has pushed several countries into state of emergency all over the world. The possible transmission of 2019−nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019−nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17−28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019−nCoV. Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory−confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019−nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative. Conclusion: 2019−nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.

A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies. We create an online database to broadly share our research outcome. Overall, we present an immunological resource for 2019-nCoV that could significantly promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-02-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhu, Na</author><author>Zhang, Dingyu</author><author>Wang, Wenling</author><author>Li, Xinwang</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Song, Jingdong</author><author>Zhao, Xiang</author><author>Huang, Baoying</author><author>Shi, Weifeng</author><author>Lu, Roujian</author><author>Niu, Peihua</author><author>Zhan, Faxian</author><author>Ma, Xuejun</author><author>Wang, Dayan</author><author>Xu, Wenbo</author><author>Wu, Guizhen</author><author>Gao, George F.</author><author>Tan, Wenjie</author><author>China Novel Coronavirus, Investigating</author><author>Research, Team</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMoa2001017</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31978945</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa2001017</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 - Zhu, Na; Zhang, Dingyu; Wang, Wenling; Li, Xinwang; Yang, Bo; Song, Jingdong; Zhao, Xiang; Huang, Baoying; Shi, Weifeng; Lu, Roujian; Niu, Peihua; Zhan, Faxian; Ma, Xuejun; Wang, Dayan; Xu, Wenbo; Wu, Guizhen; Gao, George F; Tan, Wenjie; China Novel Coronavirus, Investigating; Research, Team)

As of February 7, 2020, the total number of the confirmed cases in mainland China reached to 34,546 of whom 722 have died and 2,050 recovered. While most Chinese cities have confirmed cases, the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. The aim of this study is to model the dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend under different scenarios in mainland China. We used mobile phone data and modified the classic epidemiological Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered (SIR) model to consider several unique characteristics of the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The modified SIR model was trained using the confirmed cases from January 25 to February 1 and validated by the data collected on February 2, 2020. The prediction accuracy of new infected cases on February 2 (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 18.24) is higher than using the classic SIR model (R2 = 0.69, RMSE = 40.18). We used the trained model to predict the trend in the next 30 days (up to March 2, 2020) under different scenarios: keeping the early-stage trend, controlling the disease as successfully as SARS in 2003, and increasing person-to-person contacts due to work/school resuming. Results show that the total infected population in mainland China will be 10.53, 0.15, and 0.41 million and 67%, 100%, 91% Chinese cities will control the virus spreading by March 2, 2020 under the above three scenarios. Our study also provides the city-level spatial pattern of the epidemic trend for decision makers to allocate resources for controlling virus spreading.

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days.

With the urgent needs to assist the control of the Coronavirus spread and to provide valuable scientific information, we developed a coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online genomics and proteomics analysis platform. Based on public available coronavirus genomic information, the database annotates the genome of every strain and identifies 780 possible ORFs of all strains available in Genebank. In addition, the comprehensive evaluation of all the published genomes of Coronavirus strains, including population genetics analysis, functional analysis and structural analysis on a historical and global scale were presented in the CoVdb. In the database, the researcher can easily obtain the basic information of a Coronavirus gene with the distribution of the gene among strains, conserved or high mutation regions, possible subcellular location and topology of the gene. Moreover, sliding windows for population genetics analysis results is provided, thereby facilitating genetics and evolutional analysis at the genomic level.

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working&gt; 10 years (HR, 2.02; P&lt;0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P&lt;0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P&lt;0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.

The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.
