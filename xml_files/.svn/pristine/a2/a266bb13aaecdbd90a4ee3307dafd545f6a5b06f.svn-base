Since the first reported case in the Wuhan city of China, 2019-nCoV has spread to other cities in China as well as to multiple countries across four continents. There is an imminent need to better understand this novel virus and to develop ways to control its spread. In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against 2019-nCoV by considering the high genetic similarity between 2019-nCoV and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to 2019-nCoV proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the available 2019-nCoV sequences (as of 29 January 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against 2019-nCoV. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China. Our findings provide a screened set of epitopes that can help guide experimental efforts towards the development of vaccines against 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ai, Lizhe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling the epidemic trend of the 2019-nCOV outbreak in Hubei Province, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.20019828</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.20019828</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.30.20019828.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As of 8am 30th January (Beijing Time) 2020, Approximate 8000 cases across the world have been confirmed.

We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe appreciated the support by National Key R&amp;amp;D Program of China (Grant No: 2018YFA0606200).

As of 24:00 on February 2nd, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province has reached up to 11,177. In this paper, we select the epidemic situation in Hubei Province as the research object to establish the SEIQDR model of infectious diseases. The parameters are determined from the existing data to predict the trend of the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses, and the parameters are adjusted according to the prevention and control measures as well as possible changes. In comparison with Guangdong Province, where the SARS epidemic originated, it was concluded that the new coronavirus epidemic far exceeds the SARS epidemic in terms of infection rate and deaths. But thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the country, currently the epidemic is under control, and we predict the end of the epidemic is about 60 days earlier than the SARS virus. The total number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 26,701 (ranges from 24,355 to 32,406), and the rapid growth period is expected to be from January 27th to February 10, and the epidemic will grow slowly after February 22nd. The growth is expected to stop on March 30th (ranges from March 26th to April 19th).</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartoszewicz, Jakub M</author><author>Seidel, Anja</author><author>Renard, Bernhard Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.925354</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.925354</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/01/2020.01.29.925354.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baruah, V</author><author>Bose, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunoinformatics-aided identification of T cell and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epitope prediction</keyword><keyword>immunoinformatics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0146-6615</isbn><accession-num>32022276</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25698</electronic-resource-num><notes>1096-9071

This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding MHC class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for development of 2019-nCoV vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd &amp;lt; 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benvenuto, Domenico</author><author>Giovannetti, Marta</author><author>Ciccozzi, Alessandra</author><author>Spoto, Silvia</author><author>Angeletti, Silvia</author><author>Ciccozzi, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 2019-new coronavirus epidemic: evidence for virus evolution</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.24.915157</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.24.915157</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/24/2020.01.24.915157.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>There is concern about a new coronavirus, the 2019-nCoV, as a global public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bogoch, Isaac I</author><author>Watts, Alexander</author><author>Thomas-Bachli, Andrea</author><author>Huber, Carmen</author><author>Kraemer, Moritz U G</author><author>Khan, Kamran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential for global spread of a novel coronavirus from China</title><secondary-title>Journal of Travel Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Travel Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>taaa011</pages><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Travel</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>Zoonosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31985790</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jtm/taaa011</electronic-resource-num><notes>31985790[pmid] 5716260[PII]</notes><research-notes>31985790[pmid] 5716260[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31985790</url><url>https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa011/5716260</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bogoch, Isaac I</author><author>Watts, Alexander</author><author>Thomas-Bachli, Andrea</author><author>Huber, Carmen</author><author>Kraemer, Moritz U G</author><author>Khan, Kamran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology in Wuhan, China: Potential for International Spread Via Commercial Air Travel</title><secondary-title>Journal of travel medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of travel medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>taaa008</pages><keywords><keyword>Air Travel</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Zoonosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31943059</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jtm/taaa008</electronic-resource-num><notes>31943059[pmid] 5704418[PII]</notes><research-notes>31943059[pmid] 5704418[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31943059</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>There is currently an outbreak of a pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan, China.

We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number Rloc). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high Rloc, the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low Rloc benefit the most from policies that further reduce Rloc. Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia and Europe, and we investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementG.R. was supported by EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00008.

Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on best available evidence. We conducted a rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. 3166 papers were found and 24 included in the review. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss and stigma. Some suggested long-lasting effects. Where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine for no longer than necessary; provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be beneficial.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cai, J H</author><author>Wang, X S</author><author>Ge, Y L</author><author>Xia, A M</author><author>Chang, H L</author><author>Tian, H</author><author>Zhu, Y X</author><author>Wang, Q R</author><author>Zeng, J S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[First case of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children in Shanghai]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E002</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0578-1310 (Print)0578-1310</isbn><accession-num>32023679</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2020.0002</electronic-resource-num><notes>Cai, J H

As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city&amp;#039;s lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (2016QY02D0305), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71621002, 71771213, 71790615, 71972164 and 91846301), Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDRW-XH-2017-3), and the Hunan Science and Technology Plan Project (2017RS3040, 2018JJ1034).

Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS. We confirm high sequence similarity (&amp;gt;99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chai, Xiaoqiang</author><author>Hu, Longfei</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author><author>Han, Weiyu</author><author>Lu, Zhou</author><author>Ke, Aiwu</author><author>Zhou, Jian</author><author>Shi, Guoming</author><author>Fang, Nan</author><author>Fan, Jia</author><author>Cai, Jiabin</author><author>Fan, Jue</author><author>Lan, Fei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.931766</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.931766</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.03.931766.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo</author><author>Kok, Kin-Hang</author><author>Zhu, Zheng</author><author>Chu, Hin</author><author>To, Kelvin Kai-Wang</author><author>Yuan, Shuofeng</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan</title><secondary-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</full-title></periodical><pages>221-236</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>emerging</keyword><keyword>genome</keyword><keyword>respiratory</keyword><keyword>virus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31987001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902</electronic-resource-num><notes>31987001[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31987001[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31987001</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo</author><author>Yuan, Shuofeng</author><author>Kok, Kin-Hang</author><author>To, Kelvin Kai-Wang</author><author>Chu, Hin</author><author>Yang, Jin</author><author>Xing, Fanfan</author><author>Liu, Jieling</author><author>Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan</author><author>Poon, Rosana Wing-Shan</author><author>Tsoi, Hoi-Wah</author><author>Lo, Simon Kam-Fai</author><author>Chan, Kwok-Hung</author><author>Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man</author><author>Chan, Wan-Mui</author><author>Ip, Jonathan Daniel</author><author>Cai, Jian-Piao</author><author>Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung</author><author>Chen, Honglin</author><author>Hui, Christopher Kim-Ming</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster</title><secondary-title>Lancet (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lancet (London, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>S0140-6736(20)30154-9</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31986261</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>31986261[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30154-9[PII]</notes><research-notes>31986261[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30154-9[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986261</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

Many state-of-the-art researches  focus on predicting infection scale or threshold. Few researchers pay attention to the predicting of infection nodes from a snapshot. With developing of precision marketing,  recommending and, controlling, how to predict infection nodes precisely from snapshot becomes a key issue in spreading dynamics analysis.  In this paper, a probability based prediction model is presented so as to estimate the infection nodes from a snapshot of spreading.

Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, L</author><author>Liu, W</author><author>Zhang, Q</author><author>Xu, K</author><author>Ye, G</author><author>Wu, W</author><author>Sun, Z</author><author>Liu, F</author><author>Wu, K</author><author>Zhong, B</author><author>Mei, Y</author><author>Zhang, W</author><author>Chen, Y</author><author>Li, Y</author><author>Shi, M</author><author>Lan, K</author><author>Liu, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>RNA based mNGS approach identifies a novel human coronavirus from two individual pneumonia cases in 2019 Wuhan outbreak</title><secondary-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</full-title></periodical><pages>313-319</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Wuhan pneumonia</keyword><keyword>metagenomic next-generation sequencing</keyword><keyword>phylogenetic analyses</keyword><keyword>virus evolution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>2222-1751</isbn><accession-num>32020836</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1725399</electronic-resource-num><notes>2222-1751

We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into beta-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Nanshan</author><author>Zhou, Min</author><author>Dong, Xuan</author><author>Qu, Jieming</author><author>Gong, Fengyun</author><author>Han, Yang</author><author>Qiu, Yang</author><author>Wang, Jingli</author><author>Liu, Ying</author><author>Wei, Yuan</author><author>Xia, Jia'an</author><author>Yu, Ting</author><author>Zhang, Xinxin</author><author>Zhang, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study</title><secondary-title>Lancet (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lancet (London, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>S0140-6736(20)30211-7</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>32007143</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30211-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>32007143[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30211-7[PII]</notes><research-notes>32007143[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30211-7[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007143</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

The cause and consequence of the outbreak remain largely unknown as it is still in its early stage. As many aspects of the new virus are similar to SARS in 2003, knowledge, patterns and lessons of the SARS-CoV outbreak are valuable resources for responding to the Wuhan 2019-nCoV outbreak. Using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, we assessed and compared the characteristics of those two outbreaks and predicted the possible outcome for the current 2019-nCoV outbreak. Like the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV has a high human-to-human transmission capability and healthcare workers and family members are high risk populations. Because the early outbreak stage coincides with the Chinese spring festival travel rush, it is a challenge to prevent and control the spread of the virus. In this situation, the emergence and movement of a 2019-nCoV super-spreader is difficult to identify. Using the reported case data so far (as of Jan 23, 2019), a logistic model was built and the cumulative and daily counts of the 2019-nCoV cases were predicted. The cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. Regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent emergence and movement of a super-spreader. There is an urgent need to establish enhanced surveillance and implement efficient measures nationwide to control this epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Vincent C C</author><author>Wong, Shuk-Ching</author><author>To, Kelvin K W</author><author>Ho, P L</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preparedness and proactive infection control measures against the emerging Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia in China</title><secondary-title>The Journal of hospital infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of hospital infection</full-title></periodical><pages>S0195-6701(20)30034-7</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31962139</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhin.2020.01.010</electronic-resource-num><notes>31962139[pmid] S0195-6701(20)30034-7[PII]</notes><research-notes>31962139[pmid] S0195-6701(20)30034-7[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31962139</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chinazzi, Matteo</author><author>Davis, Jessica T</author><author>Gioannini, Corrado</author><author>Litvinova, Maria</author><author>Pastore Y Piontti, Ana</author><author>Rossi, Luca</author><author>Xiong, Xinyue</author><author>Halloran, M Elizabeth</author><author>Longini, Ira M</author><author>Vespignani, Alessandro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preliminary assessment of the International Spreading Risk Associated with the 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan City</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://j.mp/2019-nCoV-2500-10days</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Recommendations on extracorporeal life support for critically ill patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia].</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>E009</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Extracorporeal Life Support</keyword><keyword>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</keyword><keyword>Indication</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus pneumonia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32035430</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0009</electronic-resource-num><language>chi</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32035430</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Along with the sharp increase of confirmed cases novel coronavirus infection, more critically ill cases require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.

Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementGC acknowledges support from NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chung, Michael</author><author>Bernheim, Adam</author><author>Mei, Xueyan</author><author>Zhang, Ning</author><author>Huang, Mingqian</author><author>Zeng, Xianjian</author><author>Cui, Jiufa</author><author>Xu, Wenjian</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Fayad, Zahi</author><author>Jacobi, Adam</author><author>Li, Kunwei</author><author>Li, Shaolin</author><author>Shan, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200230</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>32017661</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200230</electronic-resource-num><notes>32017661[pmid]</notes><research-notes>32017661[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017661</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reviewed with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings.

This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Salazar, Pablo M</author><author>Niehus, Rene</author><author>Taylor, Aimee</author><author>Buckee, Caroline O</author><author>Lipsitch, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using predicted imports of 2019-nCoV cases to determine locations that may not be identifying all imported cases</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.04.20020495</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.04.20020495.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cases from the ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) exported from mainland China can lead to subsequent self-sustained outbreaks in other populations.

Structure analysis of the spike (S) protein of this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection.

For cases detected in Hubei, we estimate the CFR to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). For cases detected in travellers outside mainland China, we obtain central estimates of the CFR in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Zhanwei</author><author>Wang, Ling</author><author>Cauchemez, Simon</author><author>Xu, Xiaoke</author><author>Wang, Xianwen</author><author>Cowling, Benjamin J</author><author>Meyers, Lauren Ancel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan quarantine</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.20019299</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.28.20019299.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>On January 23, 2020, China enacted a travel quarantine of Wuhan and nearby cities to curb the geographic expansion of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Here, we use ground, rail and air travel data to estimate the probability that 2019-nCoV cases were imported from Wuhan to 370 cities throughout China in the three weeks prior to the quarantine. Based on an estimated R0 of 2.56 [95% CI: 2.09, 2.78], we find that the probability of a pre-quarantine introduction exceeds 50% in 131 [95% CI 72, 232] cities, including six cities with populations over two million people with no reported cases as of January 27th.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe acknowledge the financial support from NIH (U01 GM087719), the Investissement dAvenir program, the Laboratoire dExcellence Integrative Biology of Emerging Infectious Diseases program (Grant ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID) and European Union V.E.O project.

Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eurosurveillance Editorial, Team</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Note from the editors: World Health Organization declares novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sixth public health emergency of international concern</title><secondary-title>Euro Surveill</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro Surveill</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1025-496x</isbn><accession-num>32019636</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.200131e</electronic-resource-num><notes>1560-7917

Methods A descriptive analysis was utilized to explore the epidemiological characteristics. A spatial mapping description was conducted to explore the geographic characteristics. Findings China has reported 5981 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections, including 132 fatal cases until 28 January. The fatality rate was 2.21%. And there were still 9239 probable cases. From 23 January, the growth rate has been increased with a peak on 27 January. Of the neighboring provinces of Hubei, Chongqing reported the most cases until 24 January. Henan reported the most cases from 25 January to 27 January. Hunan reported the most cases on 28 January. Of the other provinces, Guangdong and Zhejiang had more confirmed cases with a higher growth rate . Interpretation The epidemic is in the stage of mass morbidity and rigorous screening for probable cases. Although the number of the cases have still increased in China, a series of prevention and control measures have been taken throughout China.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Z C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Efficient management of novel coronavirus pneumonia by efficient prevention and control in scientific manner]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>Neumonia</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1001-0939 (Print)1001-0939</isbn><accession-num>32023684</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gao, Z C

Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statement This study was partially supported by the ANR project DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03) to VC; the EU grant MOOD (H2020-874850) to MG, CP, MK, PYB, VC.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamic of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23(rd) January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus 2 closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GeneBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on the 25th November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. This article is protected by copyright.

Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKG was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship in the program for understanding dynamic &amp;amp; multiscale systems from the James S.

However, conducting bronchoscopy on patients with 2019-nCoV is a high-risk procedure in which health care workers are directly exposed to the virus, and the protection and operation procedures need to be strictly regulated. According to the characteristics of bronchoscopy, it is necessary to formulate the procedure, requirements and precautions when conducting bronchoscopy in the current epidemic situation. Relevant standards for preventing from infections should be strictly implemented in the operation of bronchoscopy. It needs to emphasize that bronchoscopy should not be used as a routine means for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection sampling. The indications for bronchoscopy for other diseases should be strictly mastered, and it is suggested that bronchoscopy should be postponed for those patients who is not in urgent situation.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guan, Wei-jie</author><author>Ni, Zheng-yi</author><author>Hu, Yu</author><author>Liang, Wen-hua</author><author>Ou, Chun-quan</author><author>He, Jian-xing</author><author>Liu, Lei</author><author>Shan, Hong</author><author>Lei, Chun-liang</author><author>Hui, David S C</author><author>Du, Bin</author><author>Li, Lan-juan</author><author>Zeng, Guang</author><author>Yuen, Kowk-Yung</author><author>Chen, Ru-chong</author><author>Tang, Chun-li</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Chen, Ping-yan</author><author>Xiang, Jie</author><author>Li, Shi-yue</author><author>Wang, Jin-lin</author><author>Liang, Zi-jing</author><author>Peng, Yi-xiang</author><author>Wei, Li</author><author>Liu, Yong</author><author>Hu, Ya-hua</author><author>Peng, Peng</author><author>Wang, Jian-ming</author><author>Liu, Ji-yang</author><author>Chen, Zhong</author><author>Li, Gang</author><author>Zheng, Zhi-jian</author><author>Qiu, Shao-qin</author><author>Luo, Jie</author><author>Ye, Chang-jiang</author><author>Zhu, Shao-yong</author><author>Zhong, Nan-shan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.06.20020974</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.06.20020974</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/02/09/2020.02.06.20020974.abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Since December 2019, acute respiratory disease (ARD) due to 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout China. We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P&amp;amp;lt;0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNAFunding StatementSupported by Ministry of Science and Technology, National Health Commission, National Natural Science Foundation, Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.One Sentence Summary It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Habibzadeh, P</author><author>Stoneman, E K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Novel Coronavirus: A Bird's Eye View</title><secondary-title>Int J Occup Environ Med</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Int J Occup Environ Med</full-title></periodical><pages>65-71</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Emerging viruses</keyword><keyword>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>SARS coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>2008-6520</isbn><accession-num>32020915</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15171/ijoem.2020.1921</electronic-resource-num><notes>2008-6814

Since then, there have been over 4000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (n-CoV) and over 100 deaths. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on 2019 n-CoV and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the 2019 n-CoV outbreak. Methodology: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In January 2020, available information on 2019 n-CoV was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For 2019 n-CoV, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Interpretation: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for 2019 n-CoV, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Xiang</author><author>Zhang, Lei</author><author>Ran, Qin</author><author>Xiong, Anying</author><author>Wang, Junyi</author><author>Wu, Dehong</author><author>Chen, Feng</author><author>Li, Guoping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Provides Insight into the Molecular Mechanisms of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20020206</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20020206</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.03.20020206.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. We also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings could explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNoAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Nevertheless, estimating $R_0$ for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of $R_0$ and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40\% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$ when predicting epidemic size.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hermanowicz, Slav W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forecasting the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemics using a simple (simplistic) model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.04.20020461</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.04.20020461</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.04.20020461.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Confirmed infection cases in mainland China were analyzed using the data up to January 28, 2020 (first 13 days of reliable confirmed cases). In addition, all available data up to February 3 were processed the same way. For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data reported until the time of writing . Using this model and the first set of data, we estimate that the maximum cases will be about 21,000 reaching this level in mid-February. Using all available data the maximum number of cases is somewhat higher at 29,000 but its dynamics does not change. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe funding agencies had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention.One sentence summary The novel 2019 coronavirus and the SARS-coronavirus share central biological properties which can guide risk assessment and intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holshue, Michelle L</author><author>DeBolt, Chas</author><author>Lindquist, Scott</author><author>Lofy, Kathy H</author><author>Wiesman, John</author><author>Bruce, Hollianne</author><author>Spitters, Christopher</author><author>Ericson, Keith</author><author>Wilkerson, Sara</author><author>Tural, Ahmet</author><author>Diaz, George</author><author>Cohn, Amanda</author><author>Fox, LeAnne</author><author>Patel, Anita</author><author>Gerber, Susan I</author><author>Kim, Lindsay</author><author>Tong, Suxiang</author><author>Lu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Lindstrom, Steve</author><author>Pallansch, Mark A</author><author>Weldon, William C</author><author>Biggs, Holly M</author><author>Uyeki, Timothy M</author><author>Pillai, Satish K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMoa2001191</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Medical Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</electronic-resource-num><notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</notes><research-notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</url><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Chaolin</author><author>Wang, Yeming</author><author>Li, Xingwang</author><author>Ren, Lili</author><author>Zhao, Jianping</author><author>Hu, Yi</author><author>Zhang, Li</author><author>Fan, Guohui</author><author>Xu, Jiuyang</author><author>Gu, Xiaoying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan , China</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><volume>6736</volume><issue>20</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30183-5</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/ S0140-6736(20)30183-5</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hui, David S</author><author>I Azhar, Esam</author><author>Madani, Tariq A</author><author>Ntoumi, Francine</author><author>Kock, Richard</author><author>Dar, Osman</author><author>Ippolito, Giuseppe</author><author>McHugh, Timothy D</author><author>Memish, Ziad A</author><author>Drosten, Christian</author><author>Zumla, Alimuddin</author><author>Petersen, Eskild</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The continuing 2019-nCoV epidemic threat of novel coronaviruses to global health - The latest 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>264-266</pages><volume>91</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Canada</pub-location><accession-num>31953166</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijid.2020.01.009</electronic-resource-num><notes>31953166[pmid] S1201-9712(20)30011-4[PII]</notes><research-notes>31953166[pmid] S1201-9712(20)30011-4[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31953166</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Baguelin, Marc</author><author>Donnelly, Christl A</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Report 3: Transmissibility of 2019-nCoV</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - Unknown - Report 3 Transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Note: This is an extended version of an analysis previously shared with WHO, governments and academic networks between 22/1/20-24/1/20 Summary Self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. We estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18 th January 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable-with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Donnelly, Christl</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Report 2: Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - Unknown - Report 2 Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China V2 (updated to include second Thai case)</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - Unknown - Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China V2 (updated to include sec.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ji, Wei</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Zhao, Xiaofang</author><author>Zai, Junjie</author><author>Li, Xingguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross-species transmission from snake to human</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1002/jmv.25682</pages><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>RSCU</keyword><keyword>cross-species transmission</keyword><keyword>phylogenetic analysis</keyword><keyword>recombination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31967321</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25682</electronic-resource-num><notes>31967321[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31967321[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31967321</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The current outbreak of viral pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans.

For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ju, Jingyue</author><author>Kumar, Shiv</author><author>Li, Xiaoxu</author><author>Jockusch, Steffen</author><author>Russo, James J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of Viral Polymerases</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.927574</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.927574</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/31/2020.01.30.927574.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies.

To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3’-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection: Inference using exported cases</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.20019547</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.29.20019547.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection who were confirmed in other countries provide a chance to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic. The proposed approach can provide insights into early risk assessment using only publicly available data.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementH.N. received funding from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [grant number: JP18fk0108050]; the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [grant numbers, H.N.: 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074; R.K.: 18J21587], the Inamori Foundation, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to &quot;Disease X&quot; (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to provide evidence of human-to-human transmission. Methods: A confirmed case of 2019-nCoV was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of 2019-nCoV in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of the confirmed cases were collected from their medical records. Exposure and travel histories were obtained by interviewing the confirmed cases. Results: Seventeen confirmed cases were identified from January 1 to 21, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, two cases (11.8%) arisen locally without travel history to Wuhan or exposure history to wildlife market within 14 days prior to the onset of illness. These two cases were from two family cluster infections including 4 and 2 index cases, respectively. The whole viral genome from the two cases was exactly the same with their index cases, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) which were predicted to cause one amino acid change in spike protein and Orf8 protein, respectively. Conclusions: This study identified two human-to-human transmitted cases of 2019-nCoV in Guangdong Province, China, which indicates that prevention strategies of cutting the person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV in households, hospitals and communities are urgently implemented.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606200, 2018YFA0606202), the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (2018B020207006, 2019B020208005, 2019B111103001), Guangzhou Science and technology Plan Project (201804010383).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Viral activate MCs release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Russell, Timothy W</author><author>Diamond, Charlie</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV: a mathematical modelling study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.31.20019901</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.31.20019901.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has led to 7818 cases as of 30th January 2020. Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection is crucial for evaluating the likely effectiveness of control measures and potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases 2019-nCoV in Wuhan and exported cases originating in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time and the likely prevalence of symptomatic cases in the city as of 23rd January 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases would generate outbreaks in other areas. We estimated that the median reproduction number, R, fluctuated between 1.6-2.9 from mid-December to mid-January 2020. We found that the US, Australia and France had more confirmed cases with travel history to Wuhan than the model predicted, and estimated that there were 29,500 (14,300-85,700) prevalent symptomatic cases in Wuhan on 23rd January 2020, when travel restrictions were introduced. Based on our estimates of R, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan, once there are more than three introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Our results show that 2019-nCoV has substantial potential for ongoing human-to-human transmission, and exported cases from Wuhan may have increased prior to travel restrictions being introduced on 23rd January 2020. As more cases arrive in international locations, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grants 206250/Z/17/Z and 210758/Z/18/Z) and HDR UK (grant: MR/S003975/1).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Design: Travel network-based modelling study. Setting and participants: General population travelling from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China. Main outcome measures: Based on de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports, we defined the relative importation risk and internal and international destinations of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China, and a high proportion of cases likely travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak. Should secondary outbreaks occur in 17 high-risk secondary cities, they could contribute to seeding the virus in other highly connected cities within and beyond China after the LNY holiday. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases seen. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was supported by the grants from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1134076); the European Union Horizon 2020 (MOOD 874850); the National Natural Science Fund of China (81773498, 71771213, 91846301); National Science and Technology Major Project of China (2016ZX10004222-009, 2018ZX10201001-010, 2018ZX10713001-007, 2017ZX10103009-005); Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader (18XD1400300); Hunan Science and Technology Plan Project (2017RS3040, 2018JJ1034).

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was provided for this work.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

As of Feb 1, 2020, at least 11,844 cases had been diagnosed in China, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine currently. Very recently report have suggest that novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV. In this report, we generated a new recombinant protein by connecting the extracellular domain of human ACE2 to the Fc region of the human immunoglobulin IgG1. An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro. As these fusion proteins exhibit cross-reactivity against coronavirus and could have potential applications for diagnosis, prophylaxis, and treatment of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Letko, Michael</author><author>Munster, Vincent</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for lineage B β-coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.22.915660</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.22.915660</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/22/2020.01.22.915660.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Geng</author><author>Fan, Yaohuao</author><author>Lai, Yanni</author><author>Han, Tiantian</author><author>Li, Zonghui</author><author>Zhou, Peiwen</author><author>Pan, Pan</author><author>Wang, Wenbiao</author><author>Hu, Dingwen</author><author>Liu, Xiaohong</author><author>Zhang, Qiwei</author><author>Wu, Jianguo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coronavirus Infections and Immune Responses</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1002/jmv.25685</pages><keywords><keyword>Chemokine</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Cytokines</keyword><keyword>Inflammation</keyword><keyword>Interferon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31981224</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25685</electronic-resource-num><notes>31981224[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31981224[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31981224</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive-sense RNA viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts. In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. Immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in pathogenesis and clinical treatment.

Antiviral drugs commonly used in clinical practice, including neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, paramivir, zanamivir, etc.), ganciclovir, acyclovir and ribavirin, are invalid for 2019-nCoV and not recommended. Drugs are possibly effective for 2019-nCoV include: remdesivir, lopinavir / ritonavir, lopinavir / ritonavir combined with interferon-beta, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies.

However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. Methods: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. Results: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation. Conclusions: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Xie, Xiaoru</author><author>Cai, Xiaomei</author><author>Huang, Jian</author><author>Tian, Xuemei</author><author>Zhu, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Game consumption and the 2019 novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30063-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30063-3</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309920300633</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Qun</author><author>Guan, Xuhua</author><author>Wu, Peng</author><author>Wang, Xiaoye</author><author>Zhou, Lei</author><author>Tong, Yeqing</author><author>Ren, Ruiqi</author><author>Leung, Kathy S M</author><author>Lau, Eric H Y</author><author>Wong, Jessica Y.</author><author>Xing, Xuesen</author><author>Xiang, Nijuan</author><author>Wu, Yang</author><author>Li, Chao</author><author>Chen, Qi</author><author>Li, Dan</author><author>Liu, Tian</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author><author>Li, Man</author><author>Tu, Wenxiao</author><author>Chen, Chuding</author><author>Jin, Lianmei</author><author>Yang, Rui</author><author>Wang, Qi</author><author>Zhou, Suhua</author><author>Wang, Rui</author><author>Liu, Hui</author><author>Luo, Yingbo</author><author>Liu, Yuan</author><author>Shao, Ge</author><author>Li, Huan</author><author>Tao, Zhongfa</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Deng, Zhiqiang</author><author>Liu, Boxi</author><author>Ma, Zhitao</author><author>Zhang, Yanping</author><author>Shi, Guoqing</author><author>Lam, Tommy T Y</author><author>Wu, Joseph T K</author><author>Gao, George F.</author><author>Cowling, Benjamin J.</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Leung, Gabriel M.</author><author>Feng, Zijian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia.</title><secondary-title>The New England journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The New England journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMoa2001316</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>31995857</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa2001316</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316</url><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31995857</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)-infected pneumonia (NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations - rT16A and rA26F - were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations - rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N - were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV - host interaction.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yan</author><author>Zhang, Jinyong</author><author>Wang, Ning</author><author>Li, Haibo</author><author>Shi, Yun</author><author>Guo, Gang</author><author>Liu, Kaiyun</author><author>Zeng, Hao</author><author>Zou, Quanming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Therapeutic Drugs Targeting 2019-nCoV Main Protease by High-Throughput Screening</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.922922</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.922922</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.28.922922.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus identified as the cause of the outbreak of pneumonia first detected in Wuhan, China. Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liang, Ye</author><author>Xu, Dan</author><author>Fu, Shang</author><author>Gao, Kewa</author><author>Huan, Jingjing</author><author>Xu, Linyong</author><author>Li, Jia-da</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Simple Prediction Model for the Development Trend of 2019-nCov Epidemics Based on Medical Observations</title><secondary-title>arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.00426</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.00426</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Applications</keyword><keyword>Quantitative Biology - Populations and Evolution</keyword><keyword>Statistics -</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200200426L</url><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00426</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In order to predict the development trend of the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCov), we established an prediction model to predict the number of diagnoses case in China except Hubei Province. From January 25 to January 29, 2020, we optimized 6 prediction models, 5 of them based on the number of medical observations to predicts the peak time of confirmed diagnosis will appear on the period of morning of January 29 from 24:00 to February 2 before 5 o'clock 24:00. Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24 o'clock on January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the 3rd has a small deviation from the actual value, and the actual value has always remained within the range predicted by the comprehensive prediction model 6. Therefore we discloses this finding and will continue to track whether this pattern can be maintained for longer. We believe that the changes medical observation case number may help to judge the trend of the epidemic situation in advance.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, L</author><author>Li, T S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpretation of &quot;Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection by the National Health Commission (Trial Version 5)&quot;</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua yi xue za zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua yi xue za zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001-E001</pages><volume>100</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>2019 Novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>guidelines</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>China</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0376-2491.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><language>chi</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32033513</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China publish the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection (trial version 5) .With the awareness and understanding of the disease, the guidelines have been revised for recognize, treat, and prevent diseases.

In this study, we built the structure models of two Wuhan pneumonia coronavirus proteases, coronavirus endopeptidase C30 and papain like viral protease, by homology modeling, followed by docking ritonavir and lopinavir to the protease models, respectively. In all the simulations, the binding between ritonavir and coronavirus endopeptidase C30 was most suitable. In addition, both ritonavir and lopinavir seemed more suitable to bind to coronavirus endopeptidase C30 than papain like viral protease. According to these results, we suggest that the therapeutic effect of Kaletra on Wuhan pneumonia, might be mainly due to the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on coronavirus endopeptidase C30.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological characteristics of novel coronavirus infection: A statistical analysis of publicly available case data</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.26.20018754</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.26.20018754</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.26.20018754.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The geographic spread of persons infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) provides an opportunity to study the natural history of the newly emerged virus. Migration events put travelers at risk of infection for the duration of their exposure to an area where transmission is known to occur. Using publicly available data of the ongoing epidemic of 2019-nCoV where event dates for cases have been shared, the present study estimated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern interpretation of the epidemiological dynamics of 2019-nCoV infections. Our results show that the incubation periods falls within the range of two to nine days with 95% confidence, and the median incubation period is 4-5 days when approximated using the Weibull distribution, which was the best fit model. The median time from illness onset to hospitalization was estimated at 3 days. Based on the estimate of the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of isolation and quarantine should be at least nine days. We also note that the median time delay of 13.8 days from illness onset to death should be considered when estimating the case fatality risk of this novel virus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementH.N. received funding from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [grant number: JP18fk0108050]; the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [grant numbers, H.N.: 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074; R.K.: 18J21587], the Inamori Foundation, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

However, the transmission dynamics of 2019-nCoV remain unclear.Methods Data of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases before January 23, 2020 were collected from medical records, epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province during 2002-2003 were obtained from Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GDCDC). Exponential Growth (EG) and maximum likelihood estimation (ML) were applied to estimate the reproductive number (R) of 2019-nCoV and SARS.Findings As of January 23, 2020, a total of 830 confirmed 2019-nCoV cases were identified across China, and 9 cases were reported overseas. The average incubation duration of 2019-nCoV infection was 4.8days. The average period from onset of symptoms to isolation of 2019-nCoV and SARS cases were 2.9 and 4.2 days, respectively. The R values of 2019-nCoV were 2.90 (95%CI: 2.32-3.63) and 2.92 (95%CI: 2.28-3.67) estimated using EG and ML respectively, while the corresponding R values of SARS-CoV were 1.77 (95%CI: 1.37-2.27) and 1.85 (95%CI: 1.32-2.49). We observe a decreasing trend of the period from onset to isolation and R values of both 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.Interpretation The 2019-nCoV may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS broken out in 2003. The implemented public-health efforts have significantly decreased the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV. However, more rigorous control and prevention strategies and measures to contain its further spread.Funding National Key Research and Development Program of China, Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, and Guangzhou Science and technology Plan Project.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Xin</author><author>Wang, Xiu-Jie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential inhibitors for 2019-nCoV coronavirus M protease from clinically approved medicines</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.924100</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.924100</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/29/2020.01.29.924100.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Starting from December 2019, a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, was found to cause Severe Acute Respiratory (SARI) symptoms and rapid pandemic in China.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCloskey, B</author><author>Heymann, D L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SARS to novel coronavirus - old lessons and new lessons</title><secondary-title>Epidemiol Infect</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiol Infect</full-title></periodical><pages>e22</pages><volume>148</volume><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>Emerging Infectious Diseases</keyword><keyword>Sars</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epidemic Response</keyword><keyword>lessons learned</keyword><keyword>novel</keyword><keyword>outbreak Response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0950-2688</isbn><accession-num>32019614</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s0950268820000254</electronic-resource-num><notes>1469-4409

Nevertheless some questions remain and not all lessons have been successful. The national and international response demonstrates the complex link between public health, science and politics when an outbreak threatens to impact on global economies and reputations. The unprecedented measures implemented in China are a bold attempt to control the outbreak - we need to understand their effectiveness to balance costs and benefits for similar events in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ming, Wai-kit</author><author>Huang, Jian</author><author>Zhang, Casper J P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breaking down of healthcare system: Mathematical modelling for controlling the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.27.922443</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.27.922443</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.27.922443.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background A novel coronavirus pneumonia initially identified in Wuhan, China and provisionally named 2019-nCoV has surged in the public. In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. Methods and Findings We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented, that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved. Conclusion The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal facemask wear) aiming at obtaining overall efficacy with at least 70% to ensure the functioning of and to avoid the breakdown of health system.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Muniz-Rodriguez, Kamalich</author><author>Chowell, Gerardo</author><author>Cheung, Chi-Hin</author><author>Jia, Dongyu</author><author>Lai, Po-Ying</author><author>Lee, Yiseul</author><author>Liu, Manyun</author><author>Ofori, Sylvia K</author><author>Roosa, Kimberlyn M</author><author>Simonsen, Lone</author><author>Viboud, Cecile G</author><author>Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemic doubling time of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak by province in mainland China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.05.20020750</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.05.20020750</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/06/2020.02.05.20020750.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We analyzed the epidemic doubling time of the 2019-nCoV outbreak by province in mainland China.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for this epidemic. However, the viral protease of a coronavirus is well-known to be essential for its replication and thus is an effective drug target. Fortunately, the sequence identity of the 2019-nCoV protease and that of severe-acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV) is as high as 96.1%. We show that the protease inhibitor binding sites of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV are almost identical, which means all potential anti-SARS-CoV chemotherapies are also potential 2019-nCoV drugs. Here, we report a family of potential 2019-nCoV drugs generated by a machine intelligence-based generative network complex (GNC). The potential effectiveness of treating 2019-nCoV by using some existing HIV drugs is also analyzed.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Miyama, Takeshi</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Jung, Sung-Mok</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Suzuki, Ayako</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Rate of Underascertainment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection: Estimation Using Japanese Passengers Data on Evacuation Flights</title><secondary-title>Journal of clinical medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of clinical medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>E419</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ascertainment</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>importation</keyword><keyword>statistical inference</keyword><keyword>travel</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Switzerland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jcm9020419</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32033064</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>From 29 to 31 January 2020, a total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China on three chartered flights. All passengers were screened upon arrival in Japan for symptoms consistent with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection and tested for presence of the virus. Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)-the actual risk of death among all infected individuals-is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura</author><author>Jung</author><author>Linton</author><author>Kinoshita</author><author>Yang</author><author>Hayashi</author><author>Kobayashi</author><author>Yuan</author><author>Akhmetzhanov</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Extent of Transmission of Novel Coronavirus in Wuhan, China, 2020</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>330</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>General &amp; Internal Medicine</keyword><keyword>emerging</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>foreigner</keyword><keyword>importation</keyword><keyword>infectious diseases</keyword><keyword>migration</keyword><keyword>travel</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jcm9020330</electronic-resource-num><notes>ISI Document Delivery No.: KH2ZW

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Sang Woo</author><author>Champredon, David</author><author>Earn, David J D</author><author>Li, Michael</author><author>Weitz, Joshua S</author><author>Grenfell, Bryan T</author><author>Dushoff, Jonathan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconciling early-outbreak preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty: a new framework and applications to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.20019877</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Park et al. - Unknown - Reconciling early-outbreak preliminary estimates of the basic reproductive number and its uncertainty a new fram.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/03/2020.01.30.20019877.full.pdf</url><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019877</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has recently emerged as a global threat. As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have prioritized estimating the basic reproductive number Ro, defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case. While these efforts are extremely valuable, their modeling approaches and the resulting estimates vary widely. Here, we present a framework for comparing different estimates of Ro across a wide range of models by decomposing it into three key quantities (the exponential growth rate r, the mean generation interval G, and the generation-interval dispersion kappa) and apply our framework to early estimates of Ro for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all three quantities, in particular in the shape of the generation-interval distribution. While rapid response during an outbreak can be valuable, avoiding over-confidence is also important. Modelers should work with field-workers to develop better methods for characterizing generation intervals.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementN.A.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(dagger) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.( section sign) Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a &quot;Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,&quot; which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phan, Lan T</author><author>Nguyen, Thuong V.</author><author>Luong, Quang C</author><author>Nguyen, Thinh V.</author><author>Nguyen, Hieu T</author><author>Le, Hung Q</author><author>Nguyen, Thuc T</author><author>Cao, Thang M</author><author>Pham, Quang D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Importation and Human-to-Human Transmission of a Novel Coronavirus in Vietnam</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMc2001272</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Medical Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMc2001272</electronic-resource-num><notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2001272</notes><research-notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2001272</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2001272</url><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2001272</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phan, Tung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus: From discovery to clinical diagnostics</title><secondary-title>Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>104211</pages><keywords><keyword>Bat</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Netherlands</pub-location><accession-num>32007627</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104211</electronic-resource-num><notes>32007627[pmid] S1567-1348(20)30043-5[PII]</notes><research-notes>32007627[pmid] S1567-1348(20)30043-5[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32007627</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A novel coronavirus designated as 2019-nCoV first appeared in Wuhan, China in late December 2019.

We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide (5’-aAT GGT GTT GAA GGT TTT AAT TGT TAC TTT CCT TTA CAA Tca-3’) sequence insertion, which shares homology to fish genomic sequence of Myripristis murdjan, an abundant fish type in Indo-Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Randhawa, Gurjit S</author><author>Soltysiak, Maximillian P M</author><author>El Roz, Hadi</author><author>de Souza, Camila P E</author><author>Hill, Kathleen A</author><author>Kari, Lila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.932350</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.932350</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.03.932350.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As of February 3, 2020, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread to 27 countries with 362 deaths and more than 17000 confirmed cases. 2019-nCoV is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus outbreak. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS resulted in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Mainland China alone suffered 349 deaths and 5327 confirmed cases. Though 2019-nCoV has a death rate of 2.2% as of 3 February, the 174895 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 3, 2020) are alarming. Cases are likely under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand rapid elucidation and analysis of the virus genomic sequence for timely treatment plans. We classify the 2019-nCoV using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, alignment-free methods that use Machine Learning (ML) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for genome analyses. Genomic sequences were mapped into their respective genomic signals (discrete numeric series) using a two-dimensional numerical representation (Chaos Game Representation). The magnitude spectra were computed by applying Discrete Fourier Transform on the genomic signals. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to calculate a pairwise distance matrix. The feature vectors were constructed from the distance matrix and used as an input to the supervised machine learning algorithms. 10-fold cross-validation was applied to compute the average classification accuracy scores. The trained classifier models were used to predict the labels of 29 2019-nCoV sequences. The classification strategy used over 5000 genomes and tested associations at taxonomic levels of realm to species. From our machine learning-based alignment-free analyses using MLDSP-GUI, we corroborate the current hypothesis of a bat origin and classify 2019-nCoV as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Read, Jonathan M</author><author>Bridgen, Jessica RE E</author><author>Cummings, Derek AT T</author><author>Ho, Antonia</author><author>Jewell, Chris P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.23.20018549</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/24/2020.01.23.20018549.full.pdf</url><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is thought to have emerged into the human population in Wuhan, China. The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJMR acknowledges support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/N014499/1) and the Medical Research Council (MR/S004793/1).

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4—3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J</author><author>Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine</author><author>Balbin-Ramon, Graciela Josefina</author><author>Rabaan, Ali A</author><author>Sah, Ranjit</author><author>Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto</author><author>Pagliano, Pasquale</author><author>Esposito, Silvano</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>History is repeating itself, a probable zoonotic spillover as a cause of an epidemic: the case of 2019 novel Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Le infezioni in medicina</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Le infezioni in medicina</full-title></periodical><pages>3-5</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Italy</pub-location><accession-num>32009128</accession-num><notes>32009128[pmid]</notes><research-notes>32009128[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009128</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pathogen transmission from a vertebrate animal to a human, also known as zoonotic spillover, represents a global public health burden, which while associated with multiple outbreaks, still remains a poorly understood phenomenon. Coronaviruses, like influenza viruses, circulate in nature in various animal species. Alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses can infect mammals and gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses tend to infect birds, but some of them can also be transmitted to mammals. Although still preliminary, current data suggest that bats are the most probable initial source of the current 2019 novel CoV (2019nCoV) outbreak, that begun on December 2019 in Wuhan, China, apparently spreading from a &quot;wet market&quot; to multiple cities and provinces in China. This epidemic of 2019nCoV, already reaching more than 6,000 cases to-day (end of January 2020) (&gt;90% in China), will not be the last one linked to zoonotic spillover events.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ronco, Claudio</author><author>Navalesi, Paolo</author><author>Vincent, Jean Louis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coronavirus epidemic: preparing for extracorporeal organ support in intensive care</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Respiratory Medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30060-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2213260020300606</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Russell, Clark D</author><author>Millar, Jonathan E</author><author>Baillie, J Kenneth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical evidence does not support corticosteroid treatment for 2019-nCoV lung injury</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30317-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620303172</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. The clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterised, little data are available that describe the disease pathogenesis, and no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist. Corticosteroids were widely used during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, 2 and are being used in patients with 2019-nCoV in addition to other therapeutics. 3 However, current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected (released Jan 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 4 Understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in 2019-nCoV is of immediate clinical importance. Here we discuss the clinical outcomes of corticosteroid use in coronavirus and similar outbreaks (table). Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are partly caused by host immune responses. Corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation but also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. In SARS-CoV infection, as with influenza, systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. 12 In SARS, inflammation persists after viral clearance. 13,14 Pulmonary histology in both SARS and MERS infections reveals inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage, 15 with one report suggesting haemophagocytosis. 16 Theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role to suppress lung inflammation. In a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, 2 almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were given corticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalent dose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25, prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). Patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. After statistical adjustment for immortal time and indication biases, the authors concluded that administration of corticosteroids was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0·8, 95% CI 0·5-1·1; p=0·12) but was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazard ratio 0·4, 95% CI 0·2-0·7; p=0·0005). However, these effect estimates have a high risk of error due to the probable presence of unmeasured confounders. In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with SARS, only four studies provided conclusive data, all indicating harm. 1 The first was a case-control study of SARS patients with (n=15) and without (n=30) SARS-related psychosis; all were given corticosteroid treatment, but those who developed psychosis were given a higher cumulative dose than those who did not (10 975 mg hydrocortisone equivalent vs 6780 mg; p=0·017). 6 The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with SARS who were not critically ill; the nine patients who were given hydrocortisone (mean 4·8 days [95% CI 4·1-5·5] since fever onset) had greater viraemia in the second and third weeks after infection than those who were given 0·9% saline control. 5 The Outcomes of corticosteroid therapy* Comment MERS-CoV Delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract 2 Adjusted hazard ratio 0·4 (95% CI 0·2-0·7) SARS-CoV Delayed clearance of viral RNA from blood 5 Significant difference but effect size not quantified SARS-CoV Complication: psychosis 6 Associated with higher cumulative dose, 10 975 mg vs 6780 mg hydrocortisone equivalent SARS-CoV Complication: diabetes 7 33 (35%) of 95 patients treated with corticosteroid developed corticosteroid-induced diabetes SARS-CoV Complication: avascular necrosis in survivors 8 Among 40 patients who survived after corticosteroid treatment, 12 (30%) had avascular necrosis and 30 (75%) had osteoporosis Influenza Increased mortality 9 Risk ratio for mortality 1·75 (95% CI 1·3-2·4) in a meta-analysis of 6548 patients from ten studies RSV No clinical benefit in children 10,11 No effect in largest randomised controlled trial of 600 children, of whom 305 (51%) had been treated with corticosteroids CoV=coronavirus.

DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs—MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shaman, Jeffrey</author><author>Galanti, Marta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct Measurement of Rates of Asymptomatic Infection and Clinical Care-Seeking for Seasonal Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.20019612</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019612</url><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/03/2020.01.30.20019612.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections.

We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms.

Purpose To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans. Materials and Methods Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women, 16-76 years old) with 2019-nCoV pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated. Results Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of the endemic center Wuhan contact. Fever (49/51, 96%) and cough (24/51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37/51, 73%), neutrophil count (44/51, 86.3%) and normal (17/51, 35.3%) or reduced (33/51, 64.7%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground grass opacity (GGO) in 39/51 (77%) patients, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38/51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30/51 (59%) and pure consolidation in 28/51 (55%) patients. 44/51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41/51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44/51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 or more days from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 or fewer days (431/712 lesions vs. 129/612 lesions, p &lt; 0.001). Patients more than 50 years old had more consolidated lung lesions than those 50 years or younger (212/470 vs. 198/854, p &lt; 0.001). Follow up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in 7 (54%) patients and progression in 4 (31%) patients. Conclusions Patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground grass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure are highly suspected of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spencer, Julie A</author><author>Shutt, Deborah P</author><author>Moser, Sarah K</author><author>Clegg, Hannah</author><author>Wearing, Helen J</author><author>Mukundan, Harshini</author><author>Manore, Carrie A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological parameter review and comparative dynamics of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human coronavirus, and adenovirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.04.20020404</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.04.20020404</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.04.20020404.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Influenza-like illness (ILI) accounts for a large burden of annual morbidity and mortality worldwide. A finer-grained knowledge of the parameters and dynamics of the viruses commonly underlying ILI is needed for modeling, diagnostic, and intervention efforts. We conducted an extensive literature review for epidemiological parameter values for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV), and adenovirus. We also developed a deterministic SEIR model for ILI, and derived an expression for R0. We here report ranges and means for parameters for these five common viruses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementResearch support provided by the U.S. Department of Energy through the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the in house research program of the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, H Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[2019-nCoV: new challenges from coronavirus]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Yu Fang Yi Xue Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Public health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0253-9624 (Print)0253-9624</isbn><accession-num>32023682</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-9624.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Tian, H Y

The virus belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Huaiyu</author><author>Li, Yidan</author><author>Liu, Yonghong</author><author>Kraemer, Moritz U G</author><author>Chen, Bin</author><author>Cai, Jun</author><author>Li, Bingying</author><author>Xu, Bo</author><author>Yang, Qiqi</author><author>Yang, Peng</author><author>Cui, Yujun</author><author>Song, Yimeng</author><author>Zheng, Pai</author><author>Wang, Quanyi</author><author>Bjornstad, Ottar N</author><author>Yang, Ruifu</author><author>Pybus, Oliver</author><author>Grenfell, Bryan</author><author>Dye, Christopher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early evaluation of the Wuhan City travel restrictions in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.20019844</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.20019844</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.30.20019844.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported in China and has spread worldwide. On January 23rd 2020 China shut down transit in and out of Wuhan, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million inhabitants, to contain the outbreak. By combining epidemiological and human mobility data we find that the travel ban slowed the dispersal of nCoV from Wuhan to other cities in China by 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29). This delay provided time to establish and reinforce other control measures that are essential to halt the epidemic. The ongoing dissemination of 2019-nCoV provides an opportunity to examine how travel restrictions impede the spatial dispersal of an emerging infectious disease.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this study was provided by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ18025); Beijing Advanced Innovation Program for Land Surface Science; National Natural Science Foundation of China (81673234); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS)(2018QNRC001)Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tu, Wenxiao</author><author>Tang, Houlin</author><author>Chen, Fangfang</author><author>Wei, Yinong</author><author>Xu, Tingling</author><author>Liao, Kaiju</author><author>Xiang, Nijian</author><author>Shi, Guoqing</author><author>Li, Qun</author><author>Feng, Zijian</author><author>Status, Epidemic</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemic Update and Risk Assessment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus — China, January 28, 2020</title><secondary-title>China CDC Weekly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>China CDC Weekly</full-title></periodical><pages>83-86</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Epidemic+Update+and+Risk+Assessment+of+2019+Novel+Coronavirus+%E2%80%94+China%2C+January+28%2C+2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://weekly.chinacdc.cn//article/id/24bdcf95-add0-49f0-8ae5-50abff657593</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tuite, A R</author><author>Fisman, D N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reporting, Epidemic Growth, and Reproduction Numbers for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Epidemic</title><secondary-title>Ann Intern Med</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ann Intern Med</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0003-4819</isbn><accession-num>32023340</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7326/m20-0358</electronic-resource-num><notes>1539-3704

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jianhui</author><author>Qi, Hongbo</author><author>Bao, Lei</author><author>Li, Fang</author><author>Shi, Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A contingency plan for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in neonatal intensive care units</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30040-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352464220300407</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jun</author><author>Zhao, Shanmeizi</author><author>Liu, Ming</author><author>Zhao, Zhiyao</author><author>Xu, Yiping</author><author>Wang, Ping</author><author>Lin, Meng</author><author>Xu, Yanhui</author><author>Huang, Bing</author><author>Zuo, Xiaoyu</author><author>Chen, Zhanghua</author><author>Bai, Fan</author><author>Cui, Jun</author><author>Lew, Andrew M</author><author>Zhao, Jincun</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author><author>Luo, Haibin</author><author>Zhang, Yuxia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.05.20020545</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.05.20020545</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/07/2020.02.05.20020545.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe National Natural Science Foundation of China (91742109, 31770978, 31722003, 31770925, 31370847, 81770552), National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0900102), National Science and Technology Major Project (2018ZX10302205), Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Research in Structural Birth Defect Disease (2019B030301004), Guangzhou Women and Children s Medical Center Fund (5001-3001032) and National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1037321, 1105209, 1143976, and 1080321 to A.L.) funded this study.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.Methods We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.Results An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10−2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10−4 to 2.72 × 10−2) for N, 5.34 × 10−3 (5.10 × 10−4, 1.28 × 10−2) for S, 1.69 × 10−3 (3.94 × 10−4, 3.60 × 10−3) for P, 1.65 × 10−3 (4.47 × 10−4, 3.24 × 10−3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.Conclusion Our analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.CoVsCoronaviruses2019-nCoV2019-novel coronavirusSARS-CoVsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusCDScoding sequencetMRCAthe most recent common ancestorGISAIDthe Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza DatabaseESSsEffective sample sizes</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, K</author><author>Lai, X Q</author><author>Liu, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Suggestions for prevention of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in otolaryngology head and neck surgery medical staff]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Er Bi Yan Hou Tou Jing Wai Ke Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus infection</keyword><keyword>advice guideline</keyword><keyword>medical protection</keyword><keyword>viral pneumonia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1673-0860 (Print)1673-0860</isbn><accession-num>32023680</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1673-0860.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Xu, K

We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of −24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and −9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively.

The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe thank for funding supports from City University of Hong Kong (#7200573 and #9610416).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Studying the epidemic dynamics is crucial for further surveillance and control of the outbreak. We employed a Bayesian framework to infer the time-calibrated phylogeny and the epidemic dynamics represented by the effective reproductive number (Re) changing over time from 33 genomic sequences available from GISAID. The time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was December 17, 2019 (95% HPD: December 7, 2019 – December 23, 2019). The median estimate of Re shifted from 1.6 to 1.1 on around January 1, 2020. This study provides an early insight of the 2019-nCoV epidemic. However, due to limited amount of data, one should be cautious when interpreting the results at this stage.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Hao</author><author>Kang, Zijian</author><author>Gong, Haiyi</author><author>Xu, Da</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Li, Zifu</author><author>Cui, Xingang</author><author>Xiao, Jianru</author><author>Meng, Tong</author><author>Zhou, Wang</author><author>Liu, Jianmin</author><author>Xu, Huji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The digestive system is a potential route of 2019-nCov infection: a bioinformatics analysis based on single-cell transcriptomes</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.927806</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.927806</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/31/2020.01.30.927806.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Since December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus (2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCov) is causing outbreak of pneumonia in one of largest cities, Wuhan, in Hubei province of China and has draw significant public health attention. The same as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2019-nCov enters into host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In order to dissect the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion and explore a potential route of the 2019-nCov infection in digestive system infection, 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed. The data showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. These results indicated along with respiratory systems, digestive system is a potential routes for 2019-nCov infection. In conclusion, this study has provided the bioinformatics evidence of the potential route for infection of 2019-nCov in digestive system along with respiratory tract and may have significant impact for our healthy policy setting regards to prevention of 2019-nCoV infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Liangsheng</author><author>Shen, Fu-Ming</author><author>Chen, Fei</author><author>Lin, Zhenguo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origin and evolution of the 2019 novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>ciaa112</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>32011673</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cid/ciaa112</electronic-resource-num><notes>32011673[pmid] 5721420[PII]</notes><research-notes>32011673[pmid] 5721420[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32011673</url><url>https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa112/5721420</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Linlin</author><author>Lin, Daizong</author><author>Kusov, Yuri</author><author>Nian, Yong</author><author>Ma, Qingjun</author><author>Wang, Jiang</author><author>von Brunn, Albrecht</author><author>Leyssen, Pieter</author><author>Lanko, Kristina</author><author>Neyts, Johan</author><author>de Wilde, Adriaan</author><author>Snijder, Eric J</author><author>Liu, Hong</author><author>Hilgenfeld, Rolf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.936898</pages><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Coxsackievirus B3</keyword><keyword>MERS</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Wuhan pneumonia coronavirus</keyword><keyword>X-ray crystallography</keyword><keyword>antiviral drug design</keyword><keyword>coronavirus main protease</keyword><keyword>enter-ovirus A71</keyword><keyword>enterovirus 3C protease</keyword><keyword>enterovirus D68</keyword><keyword>human coronavirus 229E</keyword><keyword>human coronavirus NL63</keyword><keyword>human rhinovirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.936898</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Zhang et al. - Unknown - Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication Structure-based design.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.936898</url><url>http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2020/02/10/2020.02.10.936898.abstract</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The main protease of coronaviruses and the 3C protease of enteroviruses share a similar active-site architecture and a unique requirement for glutamine in the P1 position of the substrate. Because of their unique specificity and essential role in viral polyprotein processing, these proteases are suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. In order to obtain near-equipotent, broad-spectrum antivirals against alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, and enteroviruses, we pursued structure-based design of peptidomimetic a-ketoamides as inhibitors of main and 3C proteases. Six crystal structures of protease:inhibitor complexes were determined as part of this study. Compounds synthesized were tested against the recombinant proteases as well as in viral replicons and virus-infected cell cultures; most of them were not cell-toxic. Optimization of the P2 substituent of the a-ketoamides proved crucial for achieving near-equipotency against the three virus genera. The best near-equipotent inhibitors, 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl) and 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl), display low-micromolar EC50 values against enteroviruses, alphacoronaviruses, and betacoronaviruses in cell cultures. In Huh7 cells, 11r exhibits three-digit picomolar activity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, M C</author><author>Xie, H T</author><author>Xu, K K</author><author>Cao, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Suggestions for disinfection of ophthalmic examination equipment and protection  of ophthalmologist against 2019 novel coronavirus infection].</title><secondary-title>[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>[Zhonghua yan ke za zhi] Chinese journal of ophthalmology</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32035428</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0412-4081.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><language>chi</language><urls/><abstract>At present, the prevention and treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China has reached a critical stage.

Methods The information of NCIP and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 287 confirmed NCIP patients obtained from the website of health committees of 16 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the NCIP epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed NCIP case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of NCIP were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 287 confirmed NCIP cases aged 9 months to 90 years and the average age was (42.38 ±15.97) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.35: 1. The numbers of NCIP patients in Wuhan and other inland areas were in line with Y=0.7209 x3-11.97x2+59.129x (R2=0.9858) and Y=2.2169 x3-39.74x2+158.88x (R2=0.9357)，respectively, with good fitting effects judging by their R2 values. Conclusions The fatality rate of NCIP is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of NCIP patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (68.29%). The harm of the first-generation NCIP patients is indeed higher than that of secondary cases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe present study was funded by Research Project from Health Commission of Shaanxi Provincial Government (2018A017), Research Project from Education Department of Shaanxi Provincial Government (19JS015), Subject Innovation Team of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine (132041933).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, L</author><author>Liu, H G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Early detection and disease assessment of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E003</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Antiviral therapy</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1001-0939 (Print)1001-0939</isbn><accession-num>32023686</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhou, L

Methods: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. Using a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0]. Conclusions: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl" path="2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl">2020-02-11_nCoV_manuscript_library.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Yadi</author><author>Hou, Yuan</author><author>Shen, Jiayu</author><author>Huang, Yin</author><author>Martin, William</author><author>Cheng, Feixiong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Network-based Drug Repurposing for Human Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20020263</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20020263</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.03.20020263.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), lead global epidemics with high morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNAAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

With the urgent needs to assist the control of the Coronavirus spread and to provide valuable scientific information, we developed a coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online genomics and proteomics analysis platform. Based on public available coronavirus genomic information, the database annotates the genome of every strain and identifies 780 possible ORFs of all strains available in Genebank. In addition, the comprehensive evaluation of all the published genomes of Coronavirus strains, including population genetics analysis, functional analysis and structural analysis on a historical and global scale were presented in the CoVdb. In the database, the researcher can easily obtain the basic information of a Coronavirus gene with the distribution of the gene among strains, conserved or high mutation regions, possible subcellular location and topology of the gene. Moreover, sliding windows for population genetics analysis results is provided, thereby facilitating genetics and evolutional analysis at the genomic level. CoVdb can be accessed freely at http://covdb.popgenetics.net.</abstract></record></records></xml>
