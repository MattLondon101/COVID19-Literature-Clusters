coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since december 2019. there is no cure for covid-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. here we demonstrate a crispr-cas13-based strategy, pac-man (prophylactic antiviral crispr in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade sars-cov-2 sequences and live influenza a virus (iav) genome in human lung epithelial cells. we designed and screened a group of crispr rnas (crrnas) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crrnas for cleaving sars-cov-2. the approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for h1n1 iav. our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crrnas can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. the pac-man approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.']\",\"['background: on the late december 2019, a new endemic has been spread across wuhan city, china; within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus designated as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was announced by the world health organization (who). in late january 2020, who declared the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spreading and increasing worldwide. there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; therefore, the objective of this paper is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against 2019-ncov using immunoinformatics approach. method: we will highlight a technique facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach with comparative genomic approach to determine our potential target for designing the t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-ncov as a target. results: extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in 2019-ncov strain; in addition, 10 mhc1 and mhc2 related peptides were promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99% respectively. conclusion: t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for 2019-ncov using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine rapidly needs to validates clinically to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to assist on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.']\",\"['global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. in this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from iata to predict covid-19 times of arrival (toa) for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from china. using this model trained on official first reports from who, we provide estimated toa for all other countries. by combining effective distance with a measure for the', \\\"country's\\\", 'vulnerability (infectious disease vulnerability index (idvi)), we propose a metric to rank vulnerable countries at immediate risk of case emergence. we then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the authors would like to thank

tomographic (ct) images were obtained and analyzed. findings all cases were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (sd 16.86). incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (sd 4.99). fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. we observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. there were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated c-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (icu), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. the cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time rt-pcr was 96%. one-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest ct scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time rt-pcr results. interpretation most covid-19 patients in xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. the average incubation period was longer among our patients. we recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. three times real-time rt-pcr plus two times ct scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively. key words sars-cov-2; covid-19; epidemiological and clinical features; diagnosis ### competing

reached 34,598 on 8 february 2020. in the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of covid-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in china. the proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (anfis) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (fpa) by using the salp swarm algorithm (ssa). in general, ssa is employed to improve fpa to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). the main idea of the proposed model, called fpassa-anfis, is to improve the performance of anfis by determining the parameters of anfis using fpassa. the fpassa-anfis model is evaluated using the world health organization (who) official data of the outbreak of the covid-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. more so, the fpassa-anfis model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of mean absolute percentage error (mape), root mean squared relative error (rmsre), root mean squared relative error (rmsre), coefficient of determination ( r 2 ), and computing time. furthermore, we tested the

epidemic of novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency that demands urgent analysis of its genome and solutions for detection and therapy. methods: we used a comparative pangenomic analysis of betacoronavirus sequenced thus far to detect the core and accessory gene clusters of this genus including sars-cov-2. we then annotate the functions, which are confirmed by structural analysis, and predict the potential location within the host cells of these proteins. findings: we found five accessory gene clusters common to the sars clade, including sars-cov-2, that perform functions supporting their pathogenicity. phylogenetic analysis showed one of the accessory gene clusters, the protein e, to be present across the inferred evolutionary pathway of the sars clade, including that of the horseshoe bat virus (hp-betacoronavirus/zhejiang2013), inferred to be the parental member of the clade. the e protein is highly conserved in the clade, differing between sars and sars-cov2 with a difference of single amino acid substitution and a single amino acid insertion present in sars but absent from sars-cov-2. betacoronavirus pangenomedb is available at http://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa. interpretation: the characterization and functional assessment of sars-cov-2 envelope, e, protein in gene cluster 6, together with previous findings on this protein for sars, leads us to recommend that detection of covid-2019 be developed based on the sars-cov-2 e protein and that treatment using mutated sars-cov-2 lacking the e protein be

after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has already spread worldwide. however, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in china. to assess the effect of

compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. the latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding. ### competing interest statement the authors

first suspected case of novel coronavirus (2019 ncov) infected pneumonia (ncip) on december 1st, 2019, in wuhan, hubei province, china, a total of 40,235 confirmed cases and 909 deaths have been reported in china up to february 10, 2020, evoking fear locally and internationally. here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data (who, cdc, ecdc, nhc and dxy) for hubei from january 11 to february 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (r0) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. as the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, we have repeated the calculations under a scenario that considers five times the number of confirmed infected cases and eight times the number of recovered. our computations and analysis were based on a mean field susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (sird) model. thus, based on the sird simulations, the estimated average value of r0 was found to be 2.5, while the one computed by the official counts of the confirmed cases from the 11th of january until the 18th of january was found to be 4.6. furthermore, on the estimated parameters from both scenarios, we provide tentative three-week forecasts of the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter. our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in china. based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the cumulative number of infected will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by february 29. regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of current data and estimations on the official count of infected people in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by february 29; however, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in hubei, china (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals),

for this article: a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in wuhan, china. using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percen-tile). these values should help inform 2019-ncov case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations. early january 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan, china, where the first cases had their symptom onset in december 2019 [1]. this newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2]. the key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. the range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. the distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3-5] and the transmission potential [6,7]. in absence of data on the 2019-ncov incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of sars or mers coronaviruses. here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from wuhan with confirmed 2019-ncov infection in the early outbreak phase, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates. travellers from wuhan with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, reported symptom onset data and reported travel history in january 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-ncov were detected outside wuhan. for 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 january, the travel history (to and) from wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for four cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. during this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in wuhan. consequently, their time spent in wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in wuhan for a limited time. by taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases. using the duration of stay in wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of possible values for the incubation period of each case. we fitted three parametric forms for the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the weibull distribution, the gamma distribution and the lognormal distribution. we used a bayesian approach to fitting that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. we specified strictly positive flat prior probability distributions']\",\"['since the first case of new coronavirus (2019-ncov) pneumonia appeared in wuhan, the virus has spread very rapidly in china on

health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. this can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for covid-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. methods: to estimate the burden of united states workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by standard occupational classification) maintained by the bureau of labor statistics (bls) was merged with bls o*net survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. for this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. results: based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 m) of united states workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. approximately 18.4% (26.7 m) of all united states workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. while the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. these include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). conclusions: the large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for covid-19. this work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

progressed to a pandemic with >180,000 cases in >100 countries. reproductive number (r) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. initial r values were published based on the early outbreak in china with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for sars-cov-2. methods: each', \\\"country's\\\", 'covid-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). instantaneous r estimates (wallinga and teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. findings: the country-specific r revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. outside china, r estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. geni scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. interpretation: r was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic r, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. synergistically, geni provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. we calculated an instantaneous country-specific r at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

rapid analysis using nhs health records in 3.8 million adults background: the medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the covid-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-covid-19) mortality. we estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different covid-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. methods: using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in england (hdr uk - caliber), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by uk public health england covid-19 guidelines (16 march 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged \\u226530 years from 1997-2017. we used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using icd-10 diagnosis, read, procedure and medication codes. we estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess covid-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (rr) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current phe guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged \\u226470 years with \\u22651 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, copd (0.5%). multimorbidity (co-occurrence of \\u22652 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). the 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for copd and 13.1% in those with \\u22653 or more conditions). in a suppression scenario (at sars cov2 rates of 0.001% of the uk population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, rr, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). at sars cov2 rates of 10% of the uk population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at rr 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). at sars cov2 rates of 80% in the uk population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at rr 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. interpretation: we provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from covid-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. if the relative mortality impact of covid-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. however, the relative impact of covid-19 is unknown. if the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. these results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work received no specific

closures. the evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. there is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. the likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. methods we analyze data from the us current population survey to measure the potential child care obligations for us healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. we account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. we use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a', \\\"patient's\\\", 'covid-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. findings the us healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the united states. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. we document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. for example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. a 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for covid-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. this means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. for school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in covid-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. conclusion school closures come with many tradeoffs. setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce covid-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. the results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ###

mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. to date there is still no available treatment for sars-cov-2. clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (no) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. the time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. we hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled no administered during early phases of covid-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. methods and analysis: this is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic covid-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled no at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. the primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for sars-cov-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. ethics and dissemination: the trial protocol has been approved at the investigation review boards of xijing

already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond the borders. a poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (hcws) may implicate in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. the study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of hcws about covid-19. methods: a cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among hcws about covid-19 during the first week of march 2020. a 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to hcws using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05. results: of 529 participated, a total of 453 hcws complete the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% are males, aged 25-34 years (32.1%), and most of them are doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). regarding covid-19, most of them used social media to obtain the information (61%), a significant proportion of hcws had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%), and symptoms onset (63.6%) and showed a positive perception of covid-19 prevention and control. factors such as age and profession are associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of covid-19. conclusion: as the global threat of covid-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improving knowledge and perceptions among hcws. educational interventions are urgently needed to reach hcws beyond the borders, and further studies are warranted. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

sars-cov-2 in wuhan prompted heightened surveillance in shenzhen and elsewhere in china. the resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. methods the shenzhen cdc identified 391 sars-cov-2 cases from january 14 to february 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. we compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. we estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. findings cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ors 6 and 7) than other close contacts. the household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. the observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. interpretation our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into sars-cov-2 epidemiology. this work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing r. its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. we further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

global spread. while person-to-person transmission within the wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the united states, which would allow endemic transmission. as of february 7, 2020, the number of cases in the united states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. however, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting

model to forecast the global spread of the coronavirus disease. our model contains only one fitting parameter, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. we find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data. it predicts that the disease will run its full course over six to seven months, starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the first `situation', \\\"report'\\\", '(21 january 2020 $-$ day 1). the disease may be expected to infect approximately $25\\\\\\\\%$ of the global population, i.e. about $1.95$ billion people, taking approximately $85$ million lives. unless drastic new interventions become possible, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 126 (about the middle of may 2020), with an estimated $75$ million new cases per day. since our simple model fits the available global data so well, we suggests that the measures being taken so far to contain the pandemic may be ineffective in curbing the global spread of the virus. as such, the efficacy of the measures that are currently being taken to contain the

2019-ncov infection, to predict the epidemiology of the infectious disease, and to provide a scientific basis for prevention and control measures against the new disease. methods: the meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in china in 2003. data of patients infected with 2019-ncov and sars coronavirus were collected from who website and other public sources. results: this study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-ncov coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree celsius), among which 19 degree celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. the prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north china gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree celsius. the population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in beijing, tianjin, hebei, jiangsu, zhejiang, shanghai and other urban agglomerations. starting from may 2020, the beijing-tianjin-hebei urban agglomeration, the central china zhengzhou-wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern jiangsu-zhejiang-shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern pearl river delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. conclusions: a wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-ncov. the coming of spring, in addition to the original wuhan-zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central china, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. the pearl river delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south china, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. from a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-ncov transmission before june. ### competing interest statement the

hubei province in december 2019. the illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). clinical manifestations related to sars-cov-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. world health organization (who) named the diseases associated with sars-cov-2 infection as covid-19. real time rt-pcr is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. however, the accuracy of real time rt-pcr depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of rna extraction and training of operators etc. variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. we developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect igg and igm. cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than sars-cov-2. to evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected igg and igm in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. the positive rate of igg and igm were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. by combining with real time rt-pcr detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by the

median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. the mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. the most common symptom was fever. less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. on admission, t lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the icu because of the development of organ dysfunction. compared with patients not treated in icu, patients treated in the icu were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o c, dyspnoea, reduced t lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. conclusions: in this single centre cohort of covid-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased

2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) was confirmed in the lombardy region, italy. in the week that followed, lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases. we analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the first epidemiological characterization of a covid-19 outbreak in a western country. epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. we collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. we provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval. the epidemic in italy started much earlier than february 20, 2020. at the time of detection of the first covid-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of southern-lombardy. the median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. among these, 18% required intensive care. the mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% ci, 0.7 to 19). we estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% ci, 2.9 to 3.2). we estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around february 20, 2020. we did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. the transmission potential of covid-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. we observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. aggressive containment strategies are required to control covid-19 spread and catastrophic outcomes for the healthcare system.']\",\"['a newly identified coronavirus, 2019-ncov, has been posing significant threats to public health since december 2019. ace2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-ncov infection. interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of sars and 2019-ncov patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ace2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell rna-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. the results indicated that virus might directly bind to ace2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. this finding suggested the liver abnormalities of sars and 2019-ncov patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-ncov patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.']\",\"['a mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in wuhan of china. within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was announced by the world health organization. we performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-ncov infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. overall, the genome of 2019-ncov has 89% nucleotide identity with bat sars-like-covzxc21 and 82% with that of human sars-cov. the phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human sars coronaviruses. however, the external subdomain of', \\\"spike's\\\", 'receptor binding domain of 2019-ncov shares only 40% amino acid identity with other sars-related coronaviruses. remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. learning from the roles of civet in sars and camel in mers, hunting for the animal source of 2019-ncov and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the

and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. the nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex rt-pcr, but five patients (four adults and the child) were rt-pcr positive for genes encoding the internal rna-dependent rna polymerase and surface spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by sanger sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of these five', \\\"patients'\\\", 'rt-pcr amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (sars)-related coronaviruses found in chinese horseshoe bats. interpretation: our findings are consistent with

research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. however, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. the confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of covid-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between january 20 and march 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over china, 21 cities/ provinces in italy, 21 cities/ provinces in japan, and 51 other countries around the world. four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. taken chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. the meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data.

study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. results: by feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with covid-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [iqr, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in wenzhou, china, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (p>0.05). body temperature, ck, ck-mb, ldh, and crp were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (p<0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated ck, ck-mb, ldh, and crp. urine k+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (sd=4) g potassium during hospital stay. the exciting finding was that patients responded well to k+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. conclusions: hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with covid-19. the correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal k+ loss resulting from the degradation of ace2. the end of urine k+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on ras system. ### competing interest

throughout china and across the globe. to date, few data on immunologic features of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have been reported. methods in this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan tongji hospital were included from dec 19, 2019 to jan 27, 2020. the immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. results of the 21 patients with covid-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. the average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. pao2/fio2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/l) than moderate cases (11000 million/l). alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 u/l, 567.2 u/l, 135.2 mg/l and 1734.4 ug/l) than moderate cases (17.6 u/l, 234.4 u/l, 51.4 mg/l and 880.2 ug /l). il-2r, tnf-\\u03b1 and il-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/ml, 10.9 pg/ml and 10.9 pg/ml) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/ml, 7.5 pg/ml and 6.6 pg/ml). absolute number of total t lymphocytes, cd4+t cells and cd8+t cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/l) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/l). the expressions of ifn-\\u03b3 by cd4+t cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). conclusion the sars-cov-2 infection may affect primarily t lymphocytes, particularly cd4+t cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as ifn-\\u03b3 production, which may be associated with disease severity. together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished t lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in covid-19. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work is funded by grants from

tongji hospital. we collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and sars-cov-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by rt-pcr from questionnaires and electronic medical records. results: the median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at mobile cabin hospital and tongji hospital, respectively. of 534 covid-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. the average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 \\u00b1 2.6 days (mean [sd]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three covid-19 related ocular symptoms. notably, a total of 332 covid-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. we also found that some covid-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). in consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. patients, 60.5% in mobile cabin hospital and 67.5% in tongji hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive sars-cov-2 detection. conclusions: conjunctival congestion was one of the covid-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. it is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of covid-19. further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for covid-19 control. ###

december, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) emerged in wuhan, china. we aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-ncov pneumonia. methods: in this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in wuhan jinyintan hospital from jan 1 to jan 20, 2020. cases were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. outcomes were followed up until jan 25, 2020. findings: of the 99 patients with 2019-ncov pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market. the average age of the patients was 55\\u00b75 years (sd 13\\u00b71), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-ncov was detected in all patients by real-time rt-pcr. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). according to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. interpretation: the 2019-ncov infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. in general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the mulbsta score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the mulbsta score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-ncov infection. funding: national

specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. however, the structural information of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. herein, we have determined the crystal structure of the n-terminal rna binding domain of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein. although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein n-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. further comparison with mild virus type hcov-oc43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential rna binding pocket alongside the beta-sheet core. complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein n-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to sars-cov-2.']\",\"['as reported by the world health organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was identified as the causative virus of wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by chinese authorities on 7 january, 2020. in this study, we developed a bats-hosts-reservoir-people transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. since the bats-hosts-reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as reservoir-people transmission network model. the basic reproduction number (r0) was calculated from the rp model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-ncov.']\",\"['background: although the sars-cov-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum sars-cov-2 nucleic acid (rnaaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the covid-19 patients. however, it is not clear that if the incidence of rnaaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. methods: this study enrolled 48 patients with covid-19 admitted to the general hospital of central theater command, pla, a designated hospital in wuhan, china. the patients were divided into three groups according to the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (version 6) published by the national health commission of china. the clinical and laboratory data were collected. the serum viral load detection and serum il-6 levels were determined. except for routine statistical analysis, generalized linear models (glms) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time rt-pcr ct value. findings: the result showed that cases with rnaaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. further more, the inflammatory cytokine il-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. more importantly, the extremely high il-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of rnaaemia (r=0.902) and the vital signs of covid-19 patients (r= -0.682). interpretation: serum sars-cov-2 viral load (rnaaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of covid-19 patients. moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine il-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by grants from the

recovery of sars-cov-2 infected patients. suboptimal t and b cell responses can delay viral clearance in mers and sars patients. the role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of covid-19 patients is not yet well defined.methods: from january 26 to february 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at zhongnan hospital of wuhan university, wuhan, china. we enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for sars-cov-2 infection by qrt-pcr. we comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including cd3+, cd4+, cd8+ t cells, b cells and nk cells in the patients who successfully cleared sars-cov-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. findings: in 25 enrolled covid-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. after the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for sars-cov-2. the patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of cd3+, cd4+, cd8+ t cellsand b cells as compared to the still viral rna positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. conclusions: by comparison of leukomonocytes counts in covid-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that cd3+, cd4+, cd8+ t cells and b cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. the restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an covid-19 infection. we propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the covid-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study was funded

against subsequent live sars-cov challenge. in contrast, three out of four monkeys immunized with placebo suffered severe alveolar damage and pulmonary destruction.']\",\"['we prepared the three-dimensional model of the sars-cov-2 (aka 2019-ncov) 3c-like protease (3cl <sup>pro</sup> ) using the crystal structure of the highly similar (96% identity) ortholog from the sars-cov. all residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. comparison of the polyprotein pp1ab sequences showed 86% identity. the 3c-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific

while wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. the case numbers of different provinces and cities of hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from wuhan. lockdown of 19 cities of hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. interpretation: population emigrated from wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. due to the upcoming spring festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness

outbreak remain largely unknown as it is still in its early stage. as many aspects of the new virus are similar to sars in 2003, knowledge, patterns and lessons of the sars-cov outbreak are valuable resources for responding to the wuhan 2019-ncov outbreak. using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the sars outbreak, we assessed and compared the characteristics of those two outbreaks and predicted the possible outcome for the current 2019-ncov outbreak. like the sars-cov, the 2019-ncov has a high human-to-human transmission capability and healthcare workers and family members are high risk populations. because the early outbreak stage coincides with the chinese spring festival travel rush, it is a challenge to prevent and control the spread of the virus. in this situation, the emergence and movement of a 2019-ncov super-spreader is difficult to identify. using the reported case data so far (as of jan 23, 2019), a logistic model was built and the cumulative and daily counts of the 2019-ncov cases were predicted. the cumulative counts of 2019-ncov cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of sars, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle february. regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent emergence and movement of a super-spreader. there is an urgent need to establish enhanced surveillance

purpose is to estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical modeling. methods: deterministic mathematical model(seihr) has been established to suit the korean outbreak. the number of confirmed patients in daegu and north gyeongsang province(daegu/ngp), the main area of outbreak, were used. the first', \\\"patient's\\\", 'symptom onset date was assumed on

examined rt of covid-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in hangzhou and shenzhen. methods: daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between january 1, 2020 and march 13, 2020 were analysed. a likelihood function was constructed to estimate rt, accounting for imported cases. results: although hangzhou had fewer number of cases than shenzhen, shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than hangzhou (83% vs 29%). since the epidemic of covid-19 in shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, rt was kept below unity through time. on the contrary, rt was greater than unity in hangzhou from 16 january to 7 february due to the surge in local cases. credits to the wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-february. conclusion: the lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in hangzhou

coronavirus and bat sars-like coronaviruses. the outbreak was initially detected in wuhan, a major city of china, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of china. travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. methods: we developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription pcr assays to detect two different regions (orf1b and n) of the viral genome. the primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as sars coronavirus. these assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. in addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-ncov-infected patients were tested. results: using rna extracted from cells infected by sars coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 tcid50/reaction). using dna plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. all negative control samples were negative in the assays. samples from two 2019-ncov-infected patients were positive in the tests. conclusions: the

previously unaffected country. design: simulation study setting: countries with no sustained sars-cov-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions participants: infected air travellers interventions: syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the covid-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset. main outcome measures: the achievable delay until a major local outbreak is likely to occur results: we evaluated traveller sensitisation effectiveness in reducing the number of secondary cases of 30, 50 and 70%, and assumed either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. for 50% sensitisation effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 7 days). the possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher r0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance outbreak delays. in combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. in 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 111 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 23 days) for 1 infected traveller per week and at least 9 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 4 days) for 10 infected travellers per week. conclusion: air-traveller targeted interventions, particularly in combination, can delay local sars-cov-2 outbreaks in the magnitude of a few weeks to potentially even months if the number of infected travellers remains low. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement sf and sc are supported by a sir henry

to allow over 100,000 university students to enter australia, but not tourists. we used disease incidence data from china and air travel passenger movements between china and australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. we estimated the true incidence of disease in china using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. we used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. the modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. the modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on march 6th in australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. the modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on february the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. the impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. travel restrictions were highly effective for

and reduce local transmission of covid-19 in hong kong, and there have been major changes in behaviours of the general public. we examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of covid-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with covid-19. methods: we reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on january 20-23 and february 11-14. we analysed data on laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. we estimated the daily effective reproduction number (r_t), for covid-19 and influenza a(h1n1). findings: covid-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late january, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, ci: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% ci: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. in the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. implications: containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of covid-19. the social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early february 2020. however, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population

major threat to human health, and its diffusion around the world is causing dramatic consequences. the knowledge of the 3d structures of sars-cov-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of sars-cov-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as sars-cov, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the spike proteins from sars-cov-2 and sars-cov. our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of rbds in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. these results provide a rational basis to the observation that several sars-cov rdb-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the sars-cov-2 counterpart. furthermore, we correctly identify the region of sars-cov-2 rbd that is engaged by the cell receptor ace2 during viral entry into host cells. the data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.']\",\"['introduction since the outbreak of

have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in england. methods: we adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of covid-19 in england and wales. we used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in china. results: we predict that a covid-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in england and wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from february, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in june. the starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. discussion: we provide initial estimates of the potential course of covid-19 in england and wales in the absence of control measures. these results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement ebp was funded by the national institute for health research health

laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases from publicly available official sources from december 29, 2019 to february 23, 2020. we explored the risk factors associated with mortality. we used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the cfr among detected cases. results of 12,863 cases reported outside hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. the deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. older age (or 1.18 per year; 95%ci: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (or 2.02; 95%ci: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., west and northeast vs. east, or 3.93; 95%ci: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. the estimated cfr was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. the fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. conclusions our estimates of cfr based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of hubei suggest that covid-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. the fatality risk of covid-19 is higher in males and

renal failure (arf), and elder patients (\\u2265 60 years old) are easier to develop arf (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001). comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed arf (69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001). dynamic observation of egfr revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of egfr but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. on the other hand, enhancement of egfr and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. h&e staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology or tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration. immunohistochemistry showed that sars-cov-2 np antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. conclusions the development of arf during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with covid-19. sars-cov-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage, arf and probably also lead to urine transmission. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

not been successfully developed. theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. there is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. methods we included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected sars-cov-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. we measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. we detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. results we developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of sars-cov-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. in an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed covid-19 patients. conclusions those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of covid-19. appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the sars-cov-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

of worldwide concern. however, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. this study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of covid-19. the ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. after simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. when j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. this method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic. ### competing

on the epidemic and disease control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies. methods we collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed covid-19 cases in hefei and shenzhen between january 19 and february 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). from these data we calculated basic reproduction number r0 to reflect the rate of spread of covid-19 in these cities. aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from baidu migration. the change of r0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. spearman correlation analysis between r0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. results a total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in hefei by 24:00 february 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4\\u00b115.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15\\u00b117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (hefei vs shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). before january 31 2020, during the initial stage of the level 1 response to major public health emergencies, there was no significant association observed in shenzhen between r0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (p =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in hefei, such association was strong (p =0.000, r=1.0). however, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. a weak association was observed in shenzhen between be r0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (p=0.073, r=0.536) but not in hefei (p =0.498, r=0.217). conclusion following level 1 response, consistent decline of r0 of covid-19 was observed in both hefei and shenzhen. different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. this indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.

thousand cases and over one thousand death so far.']\",\"['detailed genomic and structure-based analysis of a new coronavirus, namely 2019-ncov, showed that the new virus is a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically fairly distant from the human sars coronavirus. structure analysis of the spike (s) protein of this new virus showed that its s protein only binds weakly to the ace2 receptor on human cells whereas the human sars coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ace receptor. these findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection. these data are important to guide design of infection control policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-ncov when results of direct laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.']\",\"['we present case fatality ratio (cfr) estimates for three strata of 2019-ncov infections. for cases detected in hubei, we estimate the cfr to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). for cases detected in travellers outside mainland china, we obtain central estimates of the cfr in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in wuhan at the end of january derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to japan and germany, we adjusted the estimates of cfr from either the early epidemic in hubei province, or from cases reported outside mainland china, to obtain estimates of the overall cfr in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). it is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. cfrs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. all cfr estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland china is unclear. furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the cfr estimates.']\",\"['governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic. because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. we examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in italy and south korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. this powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for covid-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. we also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting. ### competing

2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). this study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a 2019-ncov related coronavirus model. methods a 2019-ncov related pangolin coronavirus gx_p2v/pangolin/2017/ guangxi was described. whether gx_p2x uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering rna (sirna) -mediated silencing of ace2. the pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-ncov infection. two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on vero e6 cells by gx_p2x infection. the antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. viral yields of rnas and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr) and plaque assay, respectively. results the spike protein of coronavirus gx_p2v shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-ncov isolate wuhan-hu-1, and uses ace2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-ncov. three drugs-cepharanthine (cep), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 \\u03bcmol/l. cep demonstrated the most potent inhibition of gx_p2v infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [ec50] of 0.98 \\u03bcmol/l. the viral rna yield in cells treated with 10 \\u03bcmol/l cep was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without cep treatment ([6.48 \\u00b1 0.02] \\u00d7 10vs. 1.00 \\u00b1 0.12, t = 150.38, p < 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 \\u03bcmol/l cep at 48 h p.i. furthermore, we found cep has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 \\u00b1 0.37 vs. 0.46 \\u00b1 0.12, t = 2.42, p < 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 \\u00b1 0.43 vs. [6.18 \\u00b1 0.95] \\u00d7 10, t = 3.98, p < 0.05). conclusions our pangolin coronavirus gx_p2v is a workable model for 2019-ncov research. cep, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-ncov infection. our results strongly suggest that cep is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of cep for treatment of 2019-ncov infection is warranted.']\",\"['to determine the epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) in a remote region of china, far from wuhan, we analyzed the epidemiology of covid-19 in gansu province.

liver function group than those in normal liver function group. there was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. interpretation: sars-cov-2 may cause the liver function damage and the lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of

gisaid database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. network, ebsp, mismatch, and neutrality tests) in the previous three months. the results showed that eighty haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of sars-cov-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. phylogenetic analysis showed that pangolin may not be an intermediate host. the network indicated that, in the original haplotype (h14), one patient sample lived near the huanan seafood market (approximately 2 km), which indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. however, based on this clue, we cannot accurately conclude that whether this market was the origin center of sars-cov-2. additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term, which would have led to the outbreak

scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. all included patients with moderate ncp were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe ncp (progressive group) or not (stable group). ct and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe ncp. results: a total of 141 patients with moderate ncp were included, of

epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. first we quantify the

tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. we show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to

samples from some probability distributions. for instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in china are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. hence a cmc is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a cmc, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. in this paper, a case study of using cmc that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a mc which is a common practice, a deep learning-based cmc is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. as a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted mc outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.']\",\"['epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many lives and economy damages. it is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. these measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. with only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. in the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy. in this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed...']\",\"['objective: to analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in kunming city, and to study the correlation between nutritional status and immune

with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (sars-cov-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. the aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 covid-19 patients. methods. two hundred patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection were recruited. demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. biochemical indexes on admission were measured and', \\\"patient's\\\", 'prognosis was tracked. the association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. results. of 200 covid-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. at the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of covid-19 patients. on admission, 85.5% covid-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. univariable logistic regression showed that alt and tbil, two indexes of hepatic injury, ast, myoglobin and ldh, ast/alt ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of covid-19 patients. multivariable logistic regression revealed that ast/alt ratio, urea nitrogen, tbil and ldh on admission were positively correlated with death risk of covid-19 patients. conclusion. older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of covid-19 patients. ast/alt ratio, urea nitrogen, tbil and ldh on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of covid-19

of china and overseas. it very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland china by applying boltzmann-function based regression analyses. we found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from jan 21 to feb 14, 2020 for mainland china, hubei province, wuhan city and other provinces were all well fitted with the boltzmann function (r2 being close to 0.999). the potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (ci) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 in mainland china (including hubei province) will become minimal between feb 28 and mar 10, 2020, with 95% ci. in addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 sars-cov in china

have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by sars-cov-2 infection. further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of cvl218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 infection. moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that cvl218 may bind to the n-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (n) protein of sars-cov-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. we also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of parp1 inhibitors against sars-cov-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the

and is causing outbreaks in multiple world countries, soon becoming a pandemic. italy has now become the most hit country outside of asia: on march 16, 2020, the italian civil protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for sars-cov-2. in the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. this paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. the distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even intensive care unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. we show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. simulation results are compared with real data on the covid-19 epidemic in italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.']\",\"['the 2019-ncov

its first introduction in china focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of chinese tourists arrived in italy on 23(rd) january 2020 and labeled as coronavirus italian cases. a maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-ncov plus 2 closely related bat strains (sars-like cov) available in genebank. bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in beast 1.10.4. the bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 ncov firstly introduced in wuhan on the 25th november 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including europe and italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th january 2020, the same that the chinese tourists arrived in italy. strains isolated outside china were intermixed with strains isolated in china as evidence of likely imported cases in rome, italy and europe, as well. in conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-ncov epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.']\",\"['recently emerged', \\\"wuhan's\\\", 'novel coronavirus

time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland china. a simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of covid-19. furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of covid-19 in hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in beijing, which was obtained from the ministry of public health of china in 2003. results the feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (r-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. by comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both covid-19 and sars. while all three population groups of sars are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of covid-19. conclusions our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland china very well. despite the virus caused sars (sars-cov) and the virus caused covid-19 (sars-cov-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. the

chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the wuhan regions. in this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of covid-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the wuhan regions. methods: we acquired and collected officially reported covid-19 data from 10 regions in china except for hubei province. to achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. we excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. we proposed a monte caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of covid-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. we also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. result: the incubation period of covid-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, weibull, and gamma distributions. we estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed monte carlo simulations. we found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. the former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. it further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of covid-19 along with previous

how much free volume available in a system. the transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. the obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, r0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume

cases of pneumonia of unknown aetiology. since then, there have been over 4000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (n-cov) and over 100 deaths. outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. in 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (sars-cov) and middle east respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (mers-cov). here, we review information available on 2019 n-cov and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the 2019 n-cov outbreak. methodology: three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on sars-cov and mers-cov in the outbreak setting. studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. in january 2020, available information on 2019 n-cov was reviewed and compared to the results of the sars-cov and mers-cov systematic review. results: from the research objectives for sars-cov and mers-cov, ten themes in the literature were identified: clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. for 2019 n-cov, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. interpretation: based on a systematic review of other severe

wuhan in the hubei province. with the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. the spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. previous studies showed that 2019-ncov is highly homologous to human sars-cov and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (rbd) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ii (ace2). however, the molecular mechanisms of 2019- ncov binding to human ace2 and evolution of 2019-ncov remain unclear. in this study, we have extensively studied the rbd-ace2 complex, spike protein, and free rbd systems of 2019-ncov and sars-cov using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (md) simulations. it was shown that the rbd-ace2 binding free energy for 2019-ncov is significantly lower than that for sars-cov, which is consistent the fact that 2019-ncov is much more infectious than sars-cov. in addition, the spike protein of 2019-ncov shows a significantly lower free energy than that of sars-cov, suggesting that 2019-ncov is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than sars-cov. this may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-ncov because sars-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. it was also revealed that the rbd of 2019-ncov is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ace2, compared to the rbd of sars-cov. that means that 2019-ncov will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than sars-cov. with the rising temperature, 2019-ncov is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than sars-cov, and get controlled more easily. the present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-ncov.']\",\"['we report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients and modelled covid-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample

suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. moreover, based on the expression of ace2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-ncov. analyzing the ace2 in sars-cov infected cells suggested that ace2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation,

exceedingly helpful to ensure effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. therefore, it is critical to quantify illness and fatality risk of covid-19 for the general public. in this report, we investigate the illness and fatality risk of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 mortality cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in china. our result shows a relatively low illness risk for young people but a very high fatality risk for seniors. notably, fatality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. ### competing interest statement the authors

most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. nevertheless, estimating $r_0$ for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $r_0$. here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of $r_0$ and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. to facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($r_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-ncov, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-ncov from 5-40\\\\\\\\% of susceptible individuals. taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $r_0$ when predicting epidemic size.']\",\"['background: to assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-ncov. methods: we developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-ncov outbreak. we used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 ncov-like pathogen. we considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number r0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. we assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. we measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. findings: while simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, r0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher r0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an r0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. for r0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. the delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of r0. for higher values of r0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. interpretation: we found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-ncov within three months. the probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. this model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts. ### competing

is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. to elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with covid-19 methods: in this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. pediatric cases of covid-19 were defined as patients \\u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. the primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. results: a total of 82 patients were included. the median age was 10 [iqr: 5-15] years. patients from mainland china (outside hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. a male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside china) (p=0.22). while the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in china rapidly decreased from the start point. the median reporting delay was 3 [iqr: 2-4.8] days. the median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [iqr: 0-3.25] day. in international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in china (p=0.04). when clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation

on health care professionals recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. however, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. methods: we extend the deterministic seir (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. in particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: self-monitoring and reporting (baseline seir model), quarantining the entire population, quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). we further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. results: for all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. the cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. conclusions: our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial no clinical trial conducted ### funding statement this work is funded by the

in this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. the basic reproductive ratio ( r ) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from china to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. this allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from china. we predict that r will be highest across eastern europe and japan, and lowest across africa, central america and south-western asia. this pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.

the study was to analyze the incidence of covid-19 with early renal injury, and to explore the value of multi-index combined detection in diagnosis of early renal injury in covid-19. design the study was an observational, descriptive study. setting this study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in guangdong, china. participants 12 patients diagnosed with covid-19 from january 20, 2020 to february 20, 2020. primary and secondary outcome measures the primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in covid-19. in this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), endogenous creatinine clearance (ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (uacr) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (uma), \\u03b11-microglobulin (a1m), urine immunoglobulin-g (igu), urine transferring (tru) alone and in combination in diagnosis of covid-19 with early renal injury. results while all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (scr) and blood urea nitrogen (bun), the abnormal rates of egfr, ccr, and uacr were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (auc) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in covid-19 was 0.875, which was higher than uma (0,813), a1m (0.813), igu (0.750) and tru (0.750) alone. spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to c-reactive protein (crp) and neutrophil ratio (ner), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with covid-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. conclusions early renal injury was common in patients with covid-19. combined detection of uma, a1m, igu, and tru was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in covid-19. ###

parts of the world. many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). for those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. however, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. we have developed an \\u201ceasy-to-use\\u201d mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. using the top 10 visiting cities from wuhan in china as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number r = 2.92 and latent period \\u03c4 = 5.2 days. next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low r (1.4), if the r is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. this suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. the study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the authors acknowledge the support from the grants funded by

outbreak of infections by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), the third zoonotic cov has raised great public health concern. the demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mngs) and reverse-transcription pcr (rt-pcr) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. methods: 2019-ncov infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mngs. genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, crispr-based diagnostic for this novel virus. the diagnostic performance of crispr-ncov was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mngs, rt-pcr and crispr). results: 2019-ncovs sequenced in our study were conserved with the wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with sars-cov. a high degree of variation in the level of viral rna was observed in clinical specimens. crispr-ncov demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than rt-pcr. conclusion: crispr-ncov presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen.

2020. 510 residents in wuhan and 501 residents in shanghai were randomly sampled. differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. findings proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in shanghai. during the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in wuhan (p<0.001), and 4.4% (22)

novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19) caused thousands of deaths worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. however, the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few months. thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that can be used immediately. fortunately, some compounds that can inhibit coronavirus in vitro have been reported. in this study, the coronavirus-specific dataset was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-task deep model. next we used the re-trained model to select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of sars-cov-2. the results show that abacavir, a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat hiv, is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of sars-cov-2. almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitory effect. overall, ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the important sites for these binding by our model are exhibited. we hope these results would be useful in the fight against sars-cov-2.']\",\"['the detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) diagnosis. since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 \\u2103 prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of sars-cov-2 antibodies is still unclear. by comparing the levels of sars-cov-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 \\u2103 for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to sars-cov-2. the igm levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from covid-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. the igg levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. similar changes can also be observed in the non-covid-19 diseases group (n=9). of note, 44.12% of the detected igm levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 \\u2103 for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to sars-cov-2. heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating. ### competing interest statement the authors have

limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. this study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic covid-19 virus carriers. methods: epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of covid-19 patients (or suspected patients) in nanjing, jiangsu province, china, from jan 28 to feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the covid-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest ct scans were reviewed. findings: none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical ct images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. the remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal ct image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. these seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; p = 0.012) than the rest. none of the 24 cases developed severe covid-19 pneumonia or died. the median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe covid-19 pneumonia. interpretation: the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. however, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. these results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged. ### competing interest

lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-ncov via comparison with sars-cov. our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of sars-cov, supporting that 2019-ncov may cause human transmission similar to that of sars-cov. thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged cov and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.']\",\"['background: china has been severely affected by covid-19 (corona virus disease 2019) since december, 2019. this study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. methods: using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 603 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, covid-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder-7 (gad-7), center for epidemiology scale for depression (ces-d), and pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi). logistic regression were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. results: of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of gad, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 34.0%, 18.1%, and 18.1%, respectively. young people reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than older people (p=0.024). compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (p=0.045). multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and times to focus on the covid-19 (\\u2265 3 hours per day) were associated with gad, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. conclusions: our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during covid-19 epidemic in china. young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this

transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in wuhan. we estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18 th january 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. this implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. it is likely, based on the experience of sars and mers-cov, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-ncov is highly variable-with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in china and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. in the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. it is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within china; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.']\",\"['ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) began in december 2019 in wuhan, china, and

disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. results: disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the

it has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. however, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of covid\\u221219 severity. method this study was prospectively registered on prospero. a literature search was performed in three databases (medline, embase and global health) for studies indexed up to 5th march 2020. two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. quality appraisal of studies was performed using the strobe checklist. random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe covid\\u221219 infection or icu admission. results of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 covid\\u221219 patients) were chosen for inclusion. the icu group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-icu group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (por 3.70, 95% ci 1.83 \\u2212 7.46) and icu admission (por 6.55, 95% ci 4.28 \\u2212 10.0). notwithstanding the low prevalence of copd in severe disease and icu-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), copd was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (por 6.42, 95% ci 2.44 \\u2212 16.9) and icu admission (por 17.8, 95% ci 6.56 \\u2212 48.2). cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and icu admission. those with cvd and hypertension were 4.4 (95% ci 2.64 \\u2212 7.47) and 3.7 (95% ci 2.22 \\u2212 5.99) times more likely to have an icu admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. conclusions dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and icu admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. when looking at icu-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, copd patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. to aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with covid\\u221219. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest.

(42.7% vs.16.3%, p<0.0001). fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(or1.70,95%ci 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(or3.53, 95%ci 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(or1.80,95%ci 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. conclusions: fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in covid-19 pneumonia. compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding supported the project ###

done as quickly as possible to gain a global perspective, which is a basic requirement for strengthening epidemic control capacity. however, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. we present twirls, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. twirls can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. using the twirls system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. after triggering functional changes in ace2/at2r, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the

an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of rt-pcr and chest ct in diagnosing covid-19. methods: the records including demographics, rt-pcr, and ct from 87 confirmed covid-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. the diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab rt-pcr, ct, combination with the second pharyngeal swab rt-pcr or with ct were evaluated individually. besides, all the stool rt-pcr results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool rt-pcr. findings: combination of rt-pcr and ct has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than rt-pcr alone (78.2%\\uff0c68/87) or ct alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two rt-pcr tests (86.2%,75/87). there was good agreement between rt-pcr and ct (kappa-value, 0.430). in 34 covid-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive rt-pcr. 46.7% (35/75) covid-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. interpretation: combination of rt-pcr and ct with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen covid-19. rt-pcr is superior to ct in diagnosing mild infections. stool rt-pcr should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and

reminiscent of the sars outbreak seventeen years ago. we aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both covid-19 and sars, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. methods: we extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of covid-19 in wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in china. we also analyzed the data of 524 patients with sars, including 139 deaths, from beijing city in early 2003. results: older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both covid-19 and sars. the percentages of older age (\\u226565 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both covid-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, p<0.001) and sars (37.4 vs. 4.9, p<0.001). in the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (p=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. in the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with covid-19. meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of covid-19. however, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, p=0.015). the gender role in mortality was also observed in sars patients. survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% ci] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, p= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with sars. conclusion: older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with covid. while men and women have the same susceptibility to both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. different estimates of the incubation period of covid-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. in this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. methods: we have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. the renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. findings: the estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. the estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [ci]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% ci: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% ci: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% ci: 19.47, 21.62). compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. interpretation: based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with covid-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods. ###

polymerase extension. given the 98% amino acid similarity of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rdrps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the sars-cov-2 polymerase. these results offer

facing the covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 is caused by a coronavirus named sars-cov-2. given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. all coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 prf to control the relative expression of their proteins. prior analyses of sars-cov revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mrna pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 prf, that it also harbors a -1 prf attenuation element. altering -1 prf activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. here we present a comparative analysis of the original sars-cov and sars-cov-2 frameshift signals. structural analyses reveal that the core -1 prf signal, composed of the u uua aac slippery site and three-stemmed mrna pseudoknot is highly conserved. in contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 prf and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 prf activity. we suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting sars-cov mediated -1 prf may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.']\",\"['since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) in south korea was confirmed on january 20, 2020, there have been 24 confirmed cases of 2019-ncov. the majority of these

fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. however, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. first, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. in the ongoing covid-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from covid-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. although covid-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of

regression of daily new cases. in contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, italian provinces on february 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rc/re and corresponding decrease of \\u03b2 from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. even higher reduction should take place in france, germany and spain for which \\u03b2 > 1.3 (as of march 10, 2020). considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which re decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. in such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. this scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study was

across china and ascertain the impact of control measures. early on, the spatial distribution of covid-19 cases in china was well explained by human mobility data. following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of

all parts of the world, with substantial variation in rates of transmission and severity of associated disease. methods: we evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a covid-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. we used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. the model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. findings: the analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. interpretation: isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by r0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this research was funded by the dutch ministry of health, welfare and

affected over seventeen thousand individuals, especially in china. coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (mcs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. viral activate mcs release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory il-1 family members including il-1, il-6 and il-33. here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the il-1 family members.']\",\"['a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) originating in wuhan, china presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-ncov infection. while vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-ncov upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. herein, i review the potential options to treat 2019-ncov in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. i consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral rna genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. finally, i advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. the proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-ncov entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), fused to an immunoglobulin fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. the sequence of the ace2-fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. such a treatment

to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th february 2020. understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. methods: we combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) in wuhan and international cases that originated in wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during january and february 2020. based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. findings: we estimated that the median daily reproduction number, rt , declined from 2.35 (95% ci: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd january to 1.05 (95% ci: 0.413-2.39) one week after. based on our estimates of rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as wuhan in early january, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. interpretation: our results show that covid-19 transmission likely declined in wuhan during late january 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. as more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. results: among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to china, and two were contacts of patients in this series. commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. all patients had sars-cov-2 rna detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rrt-pcr ct values often detected in the first week. sars-cov-2 rna was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. sars-cov-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and sars-cov-2 rna was detected in stool from 7/10

reach the early-middle summer. in addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic

hours after confirmed covid-19 cases were first reported. councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve covid-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. result: analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). most respondents were worried about covid-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). the anxiety level, measured by the hospital anxiety and depression scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). the most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to china were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). the adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aor]:1.27), living in the new territories (aor:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of covid-19 (aor:1.84) and being more anxious (aor:1.07). discussion: risk perception towards covid-19 in the community was high. most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. this study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current

2020. design: travel network-based modelling study. setting and participants: general population travelling from wuhan and other high-risk cities in china. main outcome measures: based on de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports, we defined the relative importation risk and internal and international destinations of 2019-ncov from wuhan and other high-risk cities in china. results: the cordon sanitaire of wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before lunar new year (lny), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in china, and a high proportion of cases likely travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak. should secondary outbreaks occur in 17 high-risk secondary cities, they could contribute to seeding the virus in other highly connected cities within and beyond china after the lny holiday. we estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% ui: 478 - 1349) had 2019-ncov infection, travelled from wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland china during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of wuhan. the majority of these cities were in asia, but major hubs in europe, the us and australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases seen. because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in china and destinations across the globe for the following three months of february to april, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. conclusion: further spread of 2019-ncov within china and international exportation is likely to occur. all countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-ncov infection. ###

still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate npis and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the world. methods: we built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (seir) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland china. we used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in wuhan to parameterise the transmission before npis were implemented. to quantify the relative effect of various npis, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across china. the model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. results: we estimated that there were a total of 114,325 covid-19 cases (interquartile range [iqr] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland china as of february 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, r2=0.86) with reported incidence. without npis, the number of covid-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (iqr: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated npis would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. if npis could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in china, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. however, if npis were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across china, respectively. results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in china to prevent case

covid-19 outbreak containment strategies in china based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (npis) appear to be effective. quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate npis and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the world. methods: we built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (seir) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland china. we used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in wuhan to parameterise the transmission before npis were implemented. to quantify the relative effect of various npis, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across china. the model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. findings: we estimated that there were a total of 114,325 covid-19 cases (interquartile range [iqr] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland china as of february 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, r2=0.86) with reported incidence. without npis, the number of covid-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (iqr: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated npis would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. if npis could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in china, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. however, if npis were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across china, respectively. results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in china to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on february 17, 2020. conclusion: the npis deployed in china appear to be effectively containing the covid-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions

in china and beyond is associated with a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed 2019-ncov. this outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in wuhan, china, where the sale of wild

report the identification of 2019-ncov related coronaviruses in pangolins (manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern china. metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated covs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-ncov related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-ncov in the receptor-binding domain. the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin

the objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the covid-19 nucleic sequence. the samples were tested using rt-lamp as well as by conventional qrt-pcr. specificity of the rt-lamp was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. rt-lamp specifically detected covid-19 in simulated patient samples. this test was performed in under 30 minutes. this approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

monitoring the emerging covid-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2). therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised solutions should be sought. recent outcomes have

hubei province of china since december 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries around the world. to better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-ncov spike receptor-binding domain (rbd) bound with the cell receptor ace2 at 2.45 angstrom resolution. the overall ace2-binding mode of the 2019-ncov rbd is nearly identical to that of the sars-cov rbd, which also utilizes ace2 as the cell receptor. structural analysis identified residues in 2019-ncov rbd critical for ace2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the sars-cov rbd. such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-ncov and sars-cov rbd for improved binding to ace2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. the epitopes of two sars-cov antibodies targeting the rbd are also analyzed with the 2019-ncov rbd, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.']\",\"['background: with its epicenter in wuhan, china, the covid-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (pheic) by the world health organization (who). consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to china. china itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of wuhan as well as the entire hubei province. however, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of covid-19 cases remains unclear. methods: we analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international covid-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. we evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases and determined the growth curves of covid-19 cases within china before and after lockdown as well as after changes in covid-19 diagnostic criteria. results: our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% confidence interval, ci): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% ci: 3.5-4.3), after imposing lockdown. a further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% ci: 15.1-26.3), respectively. moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and covid-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r=0.98, p<0.05 vs. after lockdown: r=0.91, p=ns). conclusions: a significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to chinese lockdown measures. a more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of covid-19.']\",\"['background a

intervention to control the covid-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when china relaxes the

imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. for minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. in populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. we do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. we believe that is a policy question. if an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by the

degradation of virus rna in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. with the

characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. it is important to have an estimate of the current state of covid-19 epidemic in the u.s. to develop informed public health strategies. methods: we estimated the potential scale of the covid-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the u.s. from cases imported directly from wuhan area. we used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from wuhan to the u.s and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. detection and quarantine of individual covid-19 cases in the u.s before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. we. a seir model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in wuhan area and in the u.s. results: with the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%ci 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%ci 107-2,474). conclusion: our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the us infected with sars-cov-2. our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement current research was supported

*preprint - not peer-reviewed* since the 2019-ncov (covid-19) outbreaks in wuhan, china, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. the traffic blockage and quarantine can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections. evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. we apply our flow-seir model to estimate the number of infections as well as the evaluate the policy of traffic blockage and quarantine, based on the data of confirmed case and the migration in china. we define two factors related to traffic blockage and quarantine to estimate the efficacy of these two intervation measures. in our study, since the public are urged to stay at home and self-protective, the self-protection at home is also accounted as a part of quarantine. in the simulated results, the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, when the quarantine factor \\u03b5 is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak number of infections will decrease by 89.68%. and the traffic blockage is also effective, however, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of the infections. for hubei province, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 24.26% - 25.33%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%. for the other provinces outside hubei, if the quarantine is one week of earlier, the peak number will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%. if there is one day in advance for urban blockage, about 3,600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. if there is one day of delay, about 1,800 people will finally be at risk. in general, the effect of quarantine is even stronger than the traffic blockage control. the fact should not be ignored that there are still a large number of population who are exposed to the sars-cov-2 but not yet symptomatic. those exposed population is not easy to be found and infect others who are closely contacting with. so the traffic blockage and quarantine should be continued for a long time util the epidemic is totally under control.competing interest statementthe authors have declared no competing interest.funding statementno funding supportauthor

using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (r0) of covid-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the china national health commission for the period 10th january to 8th february. we analyzed the data for the period before the closure of wuhan city (10th january to 23rd january) and the post-closure period (23rd january to 8th february) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of wuhan city on spread of covid-19. findings before the closure of wuhan city the basic reproduction number of covid-19 was 4.38 (95% ci: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% ci: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of wuhan city. over the entire epidemic period covid-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% ci:

exhibited apparent p erson-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. the capacity of vertical transmission in sars-cov-2 remains controversial recently. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is now confirmed as the receptor of sars-cov-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. in present study, we collected the online available single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ace2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. our results revealed that ace2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. meanwhile, ace2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. and in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ace2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ace2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. in summary, this study revealed that the sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs, suggesting the potential capacity for the infection of s ars-cov-2 to the fetus through the vertical transmission .']\",\"['background the ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) have caused

sixteen pregnant women with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest ct images of covid-19 pneumonia. compared to the controls, covid-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (wbc), neutrophils, c-reactive protein (crp), and alanine aminotransferase (alt) on admission. increased levels of wbc, neutrophils, eosinophils, and crp were found in

that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. to do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between pcr-confirmed sars-cov-2 positive patients (n=52) and sars-cov-2 negative patients (n=53). the patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. the rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current national and who covid-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in sars-cov-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in sars-cov-2 negative patients (36%). when the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased

we analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of ncip. methods we collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of ncip that had been reported by january 22, 2020. we described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. in the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. results among the first 425 patients with confirmed ncip, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. the majority of cases (55%) with onset before january 1, 2020, were linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [ci], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. in its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% ci, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% ci, 1.4 to 3.9). conclusions on the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of december 2019. considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

methods: we described the intensive care unit (icu) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed covid-19 patients in two chinese cities (wuhan and guangzhou) from january 10 to february 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of sars-cov-2 community spread. we estimated the peak icu bed needs in us cities if a wuhan-like outbreak occurs. results: in

ibvs (ribvs) harboring eic-inactivating mutations - rt16a and ra26f - were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (tmd). two ribvs harboring these putative eic-reverting mutations - rt16a/a26v and ra26f/f14n - were recovered. compared with the parental ribv-p65 control, all four eic mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular rna synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. our results showed that the ibv eic contributed to the induction of er stress response, as up-regulation of er stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the eic-defective mutants. eic-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative eic revertants. eic mutations were also implicated in regulating ibv-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. taken together, this study highlights the importance of cov eic in modulating virion release

cities is built. the chinese public transportation system between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). at each city, an open-system seir model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the overlying transportation network. the model accounts for (1) different transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. the model could be used to simulate the city-level spread in china (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from any chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions are implemented. flowmaps are input into the system to trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. the model is used to simulate the 2019 coronavirus epidemic in wuhan; it shows that the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.']\",\"['to investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of sars-cov-2 in china, a total of 70 genomes of

we also identified a unique peptide (prra) insertion in the human sars-cov-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the rrar motif. therefore, we concluded that the human sars-cov-2 virus, which is responsible for the

detected in wuhan, china. investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. in contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. the main protease of sars-cov is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-ncov, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. in this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with sars-cov main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising

other countries. although the virus (sars-cov-2) nucleic acid rt-pcr test has become the standard method for diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection, these real-time pcr test kits have many limitations. in addition, high false negative rates were reported. there is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. we have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect igm and igg antibodies simultaneously against sars-cov-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. with this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. the clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 pcr confirmed covid-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. the overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. in addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. the results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. the igm-igg combined assay has better utility and sensitivity

in different reports. based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. as 2019-ncov utilizes the same cell entry receptor ace2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) and ace2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-ncov, we used the single-cell rna sequencing data for analysis. we found that the ace2 mrna was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. besides, single-cell rna sequencing data showed that ace2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. thus, we suspect that ace2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-ncov infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by

fcn1+ macrophages, whereas notfabp4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in balf from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ards. these cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal cd8+ t cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of covid-19. this study first reported the cellular atlas of lung

public health threat. the covid-19 emerged in december 2019 in wuhan, china and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. the variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. as most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. method: using the cases reported from the national health commission of china and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from january 20, 2020 to feb 13, 2020 in wuhan, hubei province and other 28 provinces in china. we quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (r\\\\\\\\_t) of covid-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. findings: we estimated that r\\\\\\\\_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in hubei and other provinces. the ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from january 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on january 23, 2020. the mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. we have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around february 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in wuhan. interpretation: public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of covid-19 in wuhan and other provinces. model prediction results suggested that covid- 19 will be contained around the end of february 2020

quarantine should be at least nine days. we also note that the median time delay of 13.8 days from illness onset to death should be considered when estimating the case fatality risk of this novel

all over the world. this pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). as the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. overall, potential rt-pcr vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (ct) and rt-pcr, interpretation of rt-pcr results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative rt-pcr test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.</p>']\",\"['abstract: background: the covid-19 outbreak caused by the sars-cov-2 virus has been sustained in china since december 2019, and could become a pandemic if we do not contain it. the mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. in this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in china during the covid-19 outbreak. methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th february 2020 to 20th february 2020 in china using the zung self-rating anxiety scale (sas) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (\\u226449), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (\\u226570). we used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. we also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. results: of 512 medical staff from china, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. the prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (\\u03b2value=2.33, ci: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). similar things were observed in medical staff from hubei province, compared with those from other parts of china (\\u03b2value=3.67, ci: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). the most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (\\u03b2value=4.44, ci: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). conclusion: our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the covid-19 epidemic. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this research received no specific grant

december 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) spread from wuhan, china to the world, it has caused more than 87,000 diagnosed cases and more than 3,000 deaths globally. to fight against covid-19, we carried out research for the near native sars-cov-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. the pathogen of the covid-19, the native sars-cov-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a bsl-3 laboratory. the whole viral architecture of sars-cov-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-em). we observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. the morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the s protein of sars-cov-2 is in post-fusion state, with s1 disassociated. this state revealed by cryo-em first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.']\",\"['the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) started in the end of 2019 in china has triggered a global public health crisis. previous studies have shown that sars-cov-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), which is the same as sars-cov. the expression and distribution of ace2 in the pancreas are unknown. at the same time, the injury of pancreas after sars-cov-2 infection has not been concerned. here, we collected public datasets (bulk rna-seq and single-cell rna-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ace2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). and further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with covid-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. in the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with covid-19. this suggests that pancreatitis after sars-cov-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work. ### competing interest statement the

novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear. method: peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed covid-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. findings: of the 40 covid-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of t cells, especially cd8 + t cells, as well as increases in il-6, il-10, il-2 and ifn-\\u03b3 levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. t cell counts and cytokine levels in severe covid-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. moreover, the neutrophil-to-cd8+ t cell ratio (n8r) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe covid-19. conclusion: the degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe covid-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. n8r may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe covid-19 cases. ### competing interest statement the authors have

rapidly increased as the disease progressed. after 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. on the contrary, the positive rates of viral rna kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. in addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. interpretation the suspected patients were most likely infected by sars-cov-2. before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. the combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. after that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. keywords. sars-cov-2; diagnosis;

march 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed covid-19 cases across the us. based on our model predictions for the march 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early june, corresponding to a daily active count of \\u2248 7% of the us population, if no containment plans are implemented. epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of washington and new york by may 21 and 25, respectively. with a modest 25% reduction in covid-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. in addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations. ###

this study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of covid-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (cvms) with in-hospital outcomes of covid-19 cases. methods: retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed covid-19 were collected at the central hospital of wuhan in wuhan, china, from january 15 to january 24, 2020. epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. final date of follow-up was march 3, 2020. a comparative study was applied between cases with cvms and those without cvms. results: of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. the population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. the three most frequent symptoms of covid-19 cases analyzed were fever

methods: data on ncp cases by february 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) cases in guangdong province, beijing and hongkong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. we estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (r0) and time-varying reproduction number (rt) of ncp and sars. measurements and main results: as of february 7, 2020, 34,598 ncp cases were identified in china, and daily confirmed cases decreased after february 4. the doubling time of ncp nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of sars in guangdong (14.3 days), hong kong (5.7 days) and beijing (12.4 days). the r0 of ncp cases nationwide and in wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than r0

china spreads rapidly since december, 2019. most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. there is currently no specific medication. the purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe covid-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. methods clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type covid-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. the relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. results a total of 69 severe type covid-19 patients were included. on admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. the most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). diarrhea is less common. the most common comorbidity is hypertension. upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (ct) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), c-reactive protein (crp), ferritin and d-dimer was found in most cases. two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. however, baseline interleukin-6 (il-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to ct findings. baseline il-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of crp, ldh, ferritin and d-dimer. the increase of baseline il-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of covid-19. among the 30 severe type patients whose il-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in il-6 and improved ct assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. whereas the il-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. it is suggested that il-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe covid-19 patients. conclusions on admission, the baseline level of il-6, crp, ldh and ferritin was closely related to the severity of covid-19, and the elevated il-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. the decrease of il-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of il-6 indicated disease exacerbation. collectively, the dynamic change of il-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe covid-19. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial this is a retrospective observational study for 2019 novel

on-going gene flow. however, the genetic underpinnings, as well as the scale and magnitude at which this differentiation occurs in marine habitats are not well understood. we investigated the patterns and degree of genomic heterogeneity in threespine sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus) by assessing genetic variability in 20 nongenic and 20 genic (associated with genes important for freshwater adaptation) microsatellite loci in samples collected from 38 locations spanning the entire baltic sea coast to the north sea boundary. population divergence (f(st) \\u2248 0.026) and structuring (five genetic clusters) was significantly more pronounced in the genic as compared to nongenic markers (f(st) \\u2248 0.008; no genetic clusters). patterns of divergence in the genic markers--45% of which were identified as outliers--correlated with local differences in salinity. yet, a strong positive correlation between divergence in genic and nongenic markers, and their association with environmental factors suggests that adaptive divergence is reducing gene flow across the genome. apart from providing a clear demonstration of heterogeneous genomic patterns of differentiation in a marine species, the results are indicative of adaptive population structuring across the relatively young baltic sea in spite of ample opportunities for gene flow.']\",\"['the human coronavirus hcov-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. we screened an fda approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (dip) suppressed hcov-19 replication at an ec50 of 100 nm in vitro. it also elicited potent type i interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. in analysis of twelve hcov-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that dip supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased d-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. two weeks after initiation of dip treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. one critically ill patient with extremely high levels of d-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving dip passed away. all other patients were in clinical remission. in summary, hcov-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from dip adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. larger scale clinical trials of dip are needed to validate these therapeutic effects. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial chictr2000030055 ### funding statement national key r&d program of china

predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the qseir model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland china. the main results are as follows. if the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range february 7 to february 19, 2020. during march18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. the end date would be in the period from august 20 to september 1, 2020. with 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. the sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). the long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland china showed that the qseir model is stable and can be empirically validated. it is suggested that

the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 has spread rapidly and sparked global concern. while the transmission of sars-cov-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of sars-cov-2 has been little studied. methods: thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in patient areas (paa) and medical staff areas (msa) of renmin hospital of wuhan university (renmin) and wuchang fangcang field hospital (fangcang), and public areas (pua) in wuhan, china during covid-19 outbreak. a robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddpcr) method was employed to quantitate the viral sars-cov-2 rna genome and determine aerosol rna concentration. results: the icu, ccu and general patient rooms inside renmin, patient hall inside fangcang had undetectable or low airborne sars-cov-2 concentration but deposition samples inside icu and air sample in fangcang patient toilet tested positive. the airborne sars-cov-2 in fangcang msa had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. pua had undetectable airborne sars-cov-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. conclusions: room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of sars-cov-2. gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne sars-cov-2. the virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of sars-cov-2.']\",\"['we model the covid-19 coronavirus epidemic in china. we use early reported case data to predict the cumulative number of reported cases to a

limit human-to-human transmission. interventions that increase the speed with which infected individuals remove themselves from the susceptible population are paramount, particularly isolation and hospitalization. ebola virus disease (evd), severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission. this investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (mrr) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (dsoh) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of evd, sars, and mers, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks. we found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.']\",\"['sars-cov-2, a novel coronavirus (cov), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. while genetically distinct from the original sars-cov, both group 2b coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. importantly, initial guidance has used insights from sars-cov infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. in this report, we evaluate sars-cov-2 relative to the original sars-cov. our results indicate that while sars-cov-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to sars-cov in vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to type i interferon pretreatment. we subsequently examined homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. the absence of open reading frame (orf) 3b and significant changes to orf6 suggest the two key ifn antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in sars-cov-2. together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the ifn response between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.']\",\"['one of the reasons for the fast spread of sars-cov-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time rt-pcr and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. for this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. in addition, sars-cov-2 is remarkably similar to other coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. to tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. the proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. experiments on data from the novel coronavirus resource (2019ncovr) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify sars-cov-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as mers-cov, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-229e, hcov-hku1, and sars-cov regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). from a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying sars-cov-2 with an auc of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. then, using the same basis, we classify sars-cov-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene orf1ab from the ncbi with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. these preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for sars-cov-2. at this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning , will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. in addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the sars-cov-2 pandemic. as more data become available we will update our system.']\",\"['objective: to describe and evaluate the impact of diseases control and prevention on epidemics dynamics and clinical features of sars-cov-2 outbreak in shanghai. design: a retrospective descriptive study setting: china participants: epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients

epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. weibull distribution, chi-square test,', \\\"fisher's\\\", 'exact test, t test or mann-whitney u test were used in statistical analysis. results: covid-19 transmission rate within shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. the incubation period was 6.4 (95% ci 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% ci, 5.1 to 5.9). median time for covid-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (iqr: 4.8-11.0 days). by february 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. conclusion: strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. most covid-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction. keyword: covid-19,

we aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19, and develop a mortality risk index for covid-19 patients. methods: in this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients hospitalized in a covid-19-designated hospital from january 21 to february 5, 2020. demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. results: of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [iqr], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were

more than 2000 cases of 2019-ncov infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. methods: we did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the huanan seafood market in wuhan. complete and partial 2019-ncov genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. viral contigs were connected using sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cdna ends. phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-ncov genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. findings: the ten genome sequences of 2019-ncov obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\\u00b798% sequence identity. notably, 2019-ncov was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-like coronaviruses, bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21, collected in 2018 in zhoushan, eastern china, but were more distant from sars-cov (about 79%) and mers-cov (about 50%). phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-ncov fell within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21, and was genetically distinct from sars-cov. notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-ncov had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of sars-cov, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. interpretation: 2019-ncov is sufficiently divergent from sars-cov to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-ncov might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. the future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation. funding: national

interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (r0) of covid-19. methods between late february and early march of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside china and from 1790 publications identified in pubmed and cnki. to be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. as relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day). depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. findings in total, 1155 cases from china, japan, singapore, south korea, vietnam, germany and malaysia were included for the final analysis. the mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. r0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. for 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. in 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. in 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. asymptomatic transmission was also observed. interpretation this study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of covid-19. the findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. the estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. this together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures. ###

health, especially for those with underlined diseases. however, impacts of covid-19 epidemic on hd center and hd patients are still unknown. in this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the hd center of renmin hospital, wuhan university from january 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to february 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. there are totally 37 cases among 230 hd patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with covid-19. the epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted covid-19 were further studied. we found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on january 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on february 4, were effective in the epidemic control. no new covid-19 case had been diagnosed since february 13. during the epidemic, 7 hd patients died, including 6 with covid-19 and 1 without covid-19. the presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the hd patients infected with covid-19 decreased, and the ct images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. the symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to icu. the frequency of lymphocytes in pbmcs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in hd patients contracted covid-19 or not, non-hd covid-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. the results showed that lymphocytes of t cell, th cells, killer t cells, as well as nk cells in pbmcs of hd patients decreased significantly than other groups. hd patients with covid-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other covid-19 patients. our study indicates that hd patients are the highly susceptible population and hd centers are high risk area in the outbreak of covid-19 epidemic. measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. hd patients with covid-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. more attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of covid-19 epidemic on hd patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by the grants from the national natural science

january, 2020 to 29 february, 2020 in wuhan, china. then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of

methodologically, we introduced tpl (taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (untb) [specifically harris et al. (2015) hdp-msn model (hierarchical dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. first, tpl analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (tpl-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. another tpl parameter (m0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (covid-19/sars), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). m0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if m0 coincides or below the level of allee effects. it was found that covid-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than sars, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than sars since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. second, metacommunity untb neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. specifically, two parameters {\\\\\\\\theta} and m, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions.']\",\"['we have applied a computational strategy, based on the synergy of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease 3cl-pro$ of the

distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in mainland china, the scaling law t^\\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \\u03bc = 2.1 \\u00b1 0.3. the universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. we show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. to this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. for a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. the model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. these insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced covid-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

2019-ncov) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. the previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) in 2003, and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (mers-cov) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. the most promising compound is remdesivir (gs-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating ebola virus infections. remdesivir inhibited the replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. in addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (lpv/rtv-infb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with sars-cov. lpv/rtv-infb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with mers-cov. remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of lpv/rtv-infb against mers-cov in a transgenic humanized mice model. the relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. it remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly

reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31st january, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and icu would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively the estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved. conclusion the health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. this calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal facemask wear) aiming at obtaining overall efficacy with at least 70% to ensure the functioning of and to avoid the breakdown of health system.']\",\"['mathematical and computational modeling approaches are increasingly used as quantitative tools in the analysis and forecasting of infectious disease epidemics. the growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is however calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective descriptions of population-level contact patterns by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. we produce age-stratified contact matrices for 277 sub-national administrative regions of countries covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. we use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. the contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.']\",\"['using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members,

china excluding wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in china. we found that the latest estimates of the death risk in wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control. ### competing interest statement the authors have

hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including s-associated coronavirus strain hsr1. here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the sars-cov-2 spike s1 protein receptor binding domain (sars-cov-2 s1 rbd) and heparin. the data demonstrate an interaction between the

more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths worldwide. during the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (covid) are rising worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and control the virus with limited resource. in this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of covid to predict and control the outbreak. the basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. a detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. we calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from five provinces of china namely, hubei, guangdong, henan, zhejiang and hunan. our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ($r_0>1$, $r_c>1$) is already present in all the five provinces. short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new covid cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. however, long term predictions for hubei reveals that the symptomatic covid cases will show oscillatory behaviour. further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. numerical results show that the modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the covid cases in hubei. thus, covid is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. health care officials should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in the affected areas.']\",\"['a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) first detected in wuhan, china, has spread rapidly since december 2019, causing over 45,000 pcr confirmed infections and more than 1,000 fatalities (as of feb 12, 2020). imported cases and small transmission clusters have been reported globally. early data suggest the virus transmits readily and a pandemic cannot be ruled out. data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229e, hku1, nl63, oc43). we use these data to explore the effect of seasonal variation in transmissibility on a potential sars-cov-2 pandemic. a model allowing for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters of sars-cov-2 spread shows how a pandemic could unfold in 2020-2022. simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a peak in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere in winter 2020/2021. a smaller range of parameters suggests a peak in the first half of 2020 or two peaks of similar magnitude. variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. while the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. seasonal forcing on sars-cov-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. the likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

the significant number of fatalities. a detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. for long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. in this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. objective. since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland china, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. we will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. methods. in this study we use the known sir model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in chernivtsi (ukraine) in 1988-1989. results. the optimal values of the sir model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. the numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted. conclusions. simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-ncov in mainland china. the further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

covid-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [icus] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify covid-19 patients. containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. as of march 5, 2020, a total of 117 covid-19 cases had been identified in singapore. this report analyzes the first 100 covid-19 patients in singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. covid-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. application of the case

effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing

expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks.']\",\"['wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-ncov, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people

assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. we therefore used a bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of singapore. we estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% hpdi 22% - 64%) of singapore\\u2032s capacity. equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as singapore. using the second component of the global health security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% hpdi 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% hpdi 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% hpdi 0% - 42%). using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. we conclude that estimates of case counts in wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak. ### competing interest statement marc lipsitch has received consulting fees from merck. all other authors declare no competing interests. ### funding

super-spreading events (isse). findings: the basic reproductive number (r0) was calculated for the period between 18 january 2020 and 16 february 2020: r0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the wuhan area). at the same time, wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 february 2020. the number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the wuhan area) peaked around february 3. the results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in wuhan occurred on february 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on february 3. concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time covid-19 inpatients in wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on february 14 before it decreases. the model further shows that the covid-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of april 2020, both in wuhan and the other parts of china. the number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on march 27 in wuhan and march 19 in the entire country. the five cities with top risk index in china with the exclusion of wuhan are: huanggang, xiaogan, jingzhou, chongqing, and xiangyang city. interpretations: although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. as the return-to-work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the covid-19 in other cities outside of wuhan. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial this paper is not a clinical trials ### funding statement this study

was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and bayesian methods. results: our analysis suggests that the 2019-ncov although closely related to batcov ratg13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the bat_sars-like coronavirus sequences. specifically, in the 5\\u2032-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3\\u2032-part spanning 24,341\\u201330,696 positions, 2019-ncov and ratg13 formed a single cluster with bat_sars-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3\\u2032-end of orf1a, the orf1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-ncov and ratg13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. conclusions: the levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-ncov and ratg13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-ncov has originated from bats is very likely. we show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. these genomic features and their potential

despite relying on similar data sources. aim we aimed to develop a framework for comparing and combining different estimates of r o across a wide range of models. methods we reviewed 7 model-based analyses of the 2019-ncov outbreak that were published online between january 23--26, 2020. we decompose their r o estimates into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r , the mean

results we find that most early estimates of r o rely on strong assumptions, especially about the generation-interval dispersion. estimates that rely on narrow generation-interval distributions are overly sensitive to estimates of the exponential growth rate. conclusion our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of r o, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate r o at the outset of an epidemic. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement bmb

the rbd region of the sars-cov-2 s protein compared to sars-cov and sars-cov related bat viruses (btsars-cov). the insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ace2 receptor. epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that sars-cov neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas mers-cov neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the \\u03b2-sheet structure in mers-cov s protein and deleted in sars-cov-2 s protein. to identify effective neutralizing antibodies for sars-cov-2, the binding affinities of

need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like sars and mers, frequently encompasses the receptor binding domain (rbd) in the spike gene. we find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-ncov involving the rbd. compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-ncov accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the rbd and likewise in a region of polyprotein orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the sars 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427n and 436y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. both 427n and 436y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ace2 receptor. in sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-ncov virus whereby the 2019-ncov ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of sars by incorporation of a sars-like rbd through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.']\",\"['individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). to estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control covid-19, we fit a stochastic branching model,

only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. however, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of covid-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. in such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. to the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of covid-19. our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts. ### competing

bioinformatics. a solution would be significant as protein structure in-formation could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. this paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3d images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-em). a fully automated computationally efficient pro-tein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-em as the tech-nology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. we present a deep learning approach, deeptracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. in order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. results: we trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-em density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. we found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average rmsd value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. furthermore, we detected secondary struc-ture information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. we also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3d cryo-em density map, considering 20 dif-ferent types in total. finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of deeptracer is significantly im-proved compared to other methods. it predicts a large

accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. accordingly, we found that ly6e directly protects primary b cells and dendritic cells from

december 2019, a novel strain of sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan, china. since then, the city of wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. methods: we quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in wuhan, china, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. we included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. findings: changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). there are benefits to sustaining these measures until april in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. however, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. interpretation: restrictions on activities in wuhan, if maintained until april, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. however, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of r0 and the duration of infectiousness. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement kp, yl, mj, and pk were funded by the bill & melinda gates

population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing between 1 and 10 february, 2020 setting: wuhan (the epicentre and quarantined city), and shanghai (a typical major city with close transportation link with wuhan) participants: random sample of 510 residents in wuhan and 501 residents in shanghai aged above 18 main outcome measures: anxiety (measured by the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder [gad-7] scale), recommended and avoidance behaviors (engaged in all six behaviors such as increasing surface cleaning and reducing going out). results: the prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score \\u226510 on gad-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. for both measures, wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). the strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3). conclusions: psychological and behavioral responses to covid-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level. ### competing interest statement h.y. has received research funding from sanofi pasteur, glaxosmithkline, yichang hec changjiang pharmaceutical

zoonotically and cause severe respiratory disease syndromes. cov infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. several cov strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an s1a that engages host sialic acids and an s1b that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. as this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic cov infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine jhm-cov and human middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. these results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. however, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. this virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive s1a mutations. overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of cov infections.</p>']\",\"['background: cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) emigrated from wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. this report focused on the outside-wuhan

with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of seio (mh) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in wuhan. methods a real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of wuhan in status susceptible (s), exposed (e), infected with symptoms (i), with medical care (m), and out of the system (o) daily. model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from jan. 27th, 2020 to feb. 2nd, 2020. using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. finding according to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on nov. 29th, 2019. there had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number r\\\\\\\\_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas r\\\\\\\\_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. the peak point is feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is jun. 17th, 2020. in total, 77,453 people will be infected. if lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. a delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. interpretation our model forecasted that the peak time in wuhan was feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in wuhan is now under control. the outbreak of sars-cov-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. multiple countries including south korea, japan, iran, italy, and the united states are suffering from sars-cov-2. our study, which simulated the epidemic in wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against sars-cov-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

january 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. as with the sars-cov, infections in children appear to be rare. travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland china including germany, france, thailand, japan, south korea, vietnam, canada, and the united states, as well as hong kong and taiwan. domestically in china, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. while zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. there are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? what is the animal reservoir? is there an intermediate animal reservoir? do the vaccines generated to the sars-cov or mers-cov or their proteins offer protection against 2019-ncov? we offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. we also present data on the use of

understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. the present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-ncov genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. this ncov genotype might have been evolved from a bat-cov by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination

into their respective genomic signals (discrete numeric series) using a two-dimensional numerical representation (chaos game representation). the magnitude spectra were computed by applying discrete fourier transform on the genomic signals. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate a pairwise distance matrix. the feature vectors were constructed from the distance matrix and used as an input to the supervised machine learning algorithms. 10-fold cross-validation was applied to compute the average classification accuracy scores. the trained classifier models were used to predict the labels of 29 2019-ncov sequences. the classification strategy used over 5000 genomes and tested associations at taxonomic levels of realm to species. from our machine learning-based

is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. there is good evidence that ace2 is a receptor for 2019-ncov, and studies also suggested that high expression of ace2 may increase susceptibility to infection. here we conducted a phenome-wide mendelian randomization (mr) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ace2 expression in the lung. expression data was based on gtex. we also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in mr analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ace2 expression and may be clinically relevant. notably, mr is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. the most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ace2 expression. based on one of the largest gwas on type ii diabetes (t2dm) to date (n=898,130), we found that t2dm is causally linked to raised ace2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% ci 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49e-4; gsmr method). significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type i and ii diabetes. other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ace2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (er+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated alt, among others. we also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ace2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, vegf signaling, jak-stat signaling etc. we also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the mr analysis. in conclusion, the current mr analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ace2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. the proteome-wide mr analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ace2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study was

emerged into the human population in wuhan, china. the number of identified cases in wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 january 2020). we fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 january to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from wuhan. we estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (r_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. we estimate that only 5.1% (95%ci, 4.8-5.5) of infections in wuhan are identified, and by 21 january a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in wuhan since the start of the year. should the epidemic continue unabated in wuhan, we predict the epidemic in wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 february (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across china; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 february. our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. with these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-ncov

when novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection is suspected (released jan 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 4 understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in 2019-ncov is of immediate clinical importance. here we discuss the clinical outcomes of corticosteroid use in coronavirus and similar outbreaks (table). acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are partly caused by host immune responses. corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation but also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. in sars-cov infection, as with influenza, systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. 12 in sars, inflammation persists after viral clearance. 13,14 pulmonary histology in both sars and mers infections reveals inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage, 15 with one report suggesting haemophagocytosis. 16 theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role to suppress lung inflammation. in a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with mers, 2 almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were given corticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalent dose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25, prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. after statistical adjustment for immortal time and indication biases, the authors concluded that administration of corticosteroids was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0\\u00b78, 95% ci 0\\u00b75-1\\u00b71; p=0\\u00b712) but was associated with delayed clearance of viral rna from respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazard ratio 0\\u00b74, 95% ci 0\\u00b72-0\\u00b77; p=0\\u00b70005). however, these effect estimates have a high risk of error due to the probable presence of unmeasured confounders. in a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with sars, only four studies provided conclusive data, all indicating harm. 1 the first was a case-control study of sars patients with (n=15) and without (n=30) sars-related psychosis; all were given corticosteroid treatment, but those who developed psychosis were given a higher cumulative dose than those who did not (10 975 mg hydrocortisone equivalent vs 6780 mg; p=0\\u00b7017). 6 the second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with sars who were not critically ill; the nine patients who were given hydrocortisone (mean 4\\u00b78 days [95% ci 4\\u00b71-5\\u00b75] since fever onset) had greater viraemia in the second and third weeks after infection than those who were given 0\\u00b79% saline control. 5 the outcomes of

total of 195,892 confirmed infected cases, 80,840 recovered and 7,865 deaths have been reported worldwide up to march 16, 2020. after china, italy is currently at the forefront of the combat against the epidemic that has now spread to all 22 italian regions. the disease is sweeping through lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of march. as of the same day, the isolation measures taken in lombardy have been extended to the entire country. on march 11, the who declared covid-19 pandemic. here, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in lombardy, italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (r0); (d) the effective per-day disease transmission and mortality rates; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the released data of confirmed cases for lombardy from february 21 to march 8, the day of lockdown. methods to deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a new compartmental susceptible/ exposed/ infectious/ recovered/ dead (seird) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. the parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on covid-19. for the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in lombardy, as well as of the effective per-day transmission and mortality rates for which no clinical data are available, we have used the seird simulator to fit the data from february 21 to the 8th of march, the lockdown day of lombardy (and of all italy). this was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number r0. furthermore, by reducing the estimated transmission rate by 90% on march 8 (to reflect the lockdown of almost all activities), we run the simulator from march 8 to forecast the fade out of the outbreak. findings based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in lombardy on march 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. according to this scenario, the day-zero for the outbreak in lombardy was the 21st of january 2020. the effective per-day disease transmission rate for the period until march 8 was found to be 0.779 (90% ci: 0.777-0.781), while the \\\"effective\\\" per-day mortality rate was found to be 0.0173 (90% ci: 0.0154-0.0192). based on these values, the basic reproduction rate r0 was found to be 4.04 (90% ci: 4.03-4.05). importantly, by reducing the transmission rate by 90% on march 8 to reflect the suspension of almost all activities in italy, we run the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. simulations show that if the measures continue, the complete fade out of the outbreak in lombardy is expected to occur by the end of may 2020. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial not applicable ### funding statement no

coronavirus infection were diagnosed in wuhan, china. due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of china. currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. the sars-cov-2 mpro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. to address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the p1 position. we used it to determine the substrate preferences of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. the results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.']\",\"['deubiquitinating enzymes (dubs) are responsible for removing ubiquitin (ub) from its protein conjugates. dubs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. the lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the c-terminal ub motif or contain ub coupled to a fluorophore (z-lrgg-amc, ub-amc); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. by using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (hycosul) and a defined p2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two dubs\\u2014mers plpro and human uch-l3. based on these results, we designed and synthesized ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (abps) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the c-terminal ub motif. biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered ub-based substrates and probes. using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes ub and ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.']\",\"['overall, 37000 international students from the country of risk of 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) will arrive in south korea. the individuals

covid-19 infection in wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. we therefore used a bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection efficiency for other countries compared to that of singapore. we estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% hpdi 22% - 64%) of singapore\\u2032s capacity. equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as singapore. using the second component of the global health security index to stratify country likely detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% hpdi 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% hpdi 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% hpdi 0% - 42%). we conclude that estimates of case counts in wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

infected more than 75,000 individuals and spread to over 20 countries. it is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. methods: we have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight sars-cov-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients, and 20 healthy controls. results: the median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in sars-cov-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. the distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). however, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. the microbiota in sars-cov-2 infected patients was similar to those in cap, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. conclusion: sars-cov-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.']\",\"['background a

outbound traffic from wuhan and the incidence of covid-19 in 31 chinese provinces during january-february 2020. methods: we collected incidence of confirmed covid-19 cases from national and provincial health committee reports from january 10 to february 29, 2020. volume of outbound traffic from wuhan to other provinces was measured by baidu migration index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. we used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and covid-19 incidence by province. contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of covid-19

wuhan, central china and rapidly spread throughout china. up to march 3, 2020, sars-cov-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in china and other 66 countries across six continents. in this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of sars-cov-2 and combined 136 genomes from gisaid database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. network, ebsp, mismatch, and neutrality tests) in the previous three months. the results showed that eighty haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of sars-cov-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. phylogenetic analysis showed that pangolin may not be an intermediate host. the network indicated that, in the original haplotype (h14), one patient sample lived near the huanan seafood market (approximately 2 km), which indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. however, based on this clue, we cannot accurately conclude that whether this market was the origin center of sars-cov-2. additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term, which would have led to the outbreak of sars-cov-2 in wuhan and other areas. the ebsp results showed that the first estimated expansion date began from 7 december 2019, which indicated that the transmission of sars-cov-2 could have begun from person to person in mid to late november.']\",\"['we analyze the spread of covid-19 by considering the transmission of the disease among individuals both within and between communities. a set of communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g. the u.s. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). covid-19 can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the expected/average number of other communities to which a single infected community will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. we find that this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before community-level action is taken. thus, reductions in travel and the speed at which communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak. the analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not necessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at once, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. the sooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in place. if infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the future) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities (and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will exponentially decrease over time.']\",\"['background since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, multiple efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the

probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model. interpretation parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both r0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. this is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented covid-19 cases. consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis. ### competing interest

epidemic on mental health of medical workers, as well as its impact factors, remains unknown. we assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia in medical workers and the effect of social support in china during covid-19 epidemic. methods: we conducted this study using online questionnaires via a social networking software, wechat, within a week from feb 9th 2020 to feb 15th 2020. symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia were measured by zung self-rating anxiety scale (sas), chinese version of center for epidemiologic studies depression scale and insomnia severity index, respetively. the assessment of social support was measured by the social support rating scale. results: among all the 5393 respondents, anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms of the population accounted for 5.9%, 28% and 34.3% of the total sample group, respectively. female, contact with confirmed or suspected cases, work in the clinical first-line, low social support total score and low

of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into covid-19 group. multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis were used for model validation. results after analysis, signs of pneumonia on ct, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (nlr), tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into covid-19 early warning score (covid-19 ews). the areas under the roc curve (auroc) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%ci 0.935-0.977, p <

has subsequently been spread world-widely. as the covid-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (ct) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify covid-19-infected patients by ct images. materials and methods we collected chest ct scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the covid-19 from hospitals of two provinces in china, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based ct diagnosis system (deeppneumonia) was developed to identify patients with covid-19. results the experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the covid-19 patients from others with an excellent auc of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. in addition, our model was capable of discriminating the covid-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an auc of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (ggo) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. the diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously.

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. these measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of covid-19 in us cities from march 14th through march 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. this means that covid-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. we discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the covid-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also with preserving socioeconomic activity.']\",\"['the recent emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-ncov) has gained a high cover in public media and worldwide news. this caused a viral pneumonia in thousands of people in wuhan, a central city of china. this short communication gives a brief introduction on how the demand for information on this new epidemic is reported through google trends. author draw conclusions on current infodemiological data on 2019-ncov using three main search queries: coronavirus, sars and mers. two approaches are set. first is worldwide perspective, second is chinese perspective. chinese perspective reveals that in china, this disease in the beginning days was more often referred to sars then to general coronaviruses, whereas worldwide, since the beginning is more often referred to coronaviruses.']\",\"['to date, the sars-cov-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than sars-cov or mers-cov. here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (orf8) of sars-cov-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in singapore. the deletion also removes the orf8 transcription-regulatory sequence (trs), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the n gene. we also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. during the sars-cov outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population, and similar variation has since been observed across sars-related covs in humans and bats. overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in orf8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus. this is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human sars cases possessed an orf8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation. we therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of sars-cov-2.']\",\"['the respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from china and caused more than 1000 death globally since december 2019. this new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) uses the same receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) seventeen years ago. both viruses recognize ace2 through the spike proteins (s-protein) on their surfaces. it was found that the s-protein from the sars coronavirus (sars-cov) bind stronger to ace2 than 2019-ncov. however, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. to address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ace2 and the s-protein from 2019-ncov, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of s-protein from sars-cov by a multiscale simulation method. our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than sars, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. we further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than sars.']\",\"['2019\\u5e7412\\u6708\\u5f00\\u59cb\\uff0c\\u6e56\\u5317\\u7701\\u6b66\\u6c49\\u5e02\\u9646\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u73b0\\u65b0\\u578b\\u51a0\\u72b6\\u75c5\\u6bd2\\uff082019-ncov\\uff09\\u611f\\u67d3\\u75c5\\u4f8b\\uff0c\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u8513\\u5ef6\\u81f3\\u6211\\u56fd\\u5404\\u5730\\u53ca\\u5883\\u5916\\u3002\\u4eba\\u7fa4\\u666e\\u904d\\u6613\\u611f\\uff0c\\u5df2\\u9646\\u7eed\\u53d1\\u73b0\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u75c5\\u4f8b\\u3002\\u53d1\\u70ed\\u4e0d\\u518d\\u662f\\u65e9\\u671f\\u7684\\u4e3b\\u8981\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4e3a\\u4e4f\\u529b\\u3001\\u5e72\\u54b3\\u548c\\u6076\\u5fc3\\u3001\\u5455\\u5410\\u7b49\\u75c7\\u72b6\\uff0c\\u5c11\\u6570\\u611f\\u67d3\\u8005\\u4ee5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u9053\\u75c7\\u72b6\\u4e3a\\u9996\\u53d1\\u8868\\u73b0\\u800c\\u5c31\\u8bca\\u3002\\u5728\\u9f3b\\u54bd\\u62ed\\u5b50\\u3001\\u75f0\\u3001\\u4e0b\\u547c\\u5438\\u9053\\u5206\\u6ccc\\u7269\\u3001\\u8840\\u6db2\\u3001\\u7caa\\u4fbf\\u7b49\\u6807\\u672c\\u4e2d\\u53ef\\u68c0\\u6d4b\\u51fa2019-ncov\\u6838\\u9178\\u3002\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u6d41\\u884c\\u671f\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u539f\\u5219\\u4e0a\\u5982\\u975e\\u5fc5\\u987b\\uff0c\\u5e94\\u63a8\\u8fdf\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u8bca\\u7597\\u3002\\u4f46\\u75c5\\u60c5\\u9700\\u8981\\u6216\\u9700\\u6025\\u8bca\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u8bca\\u7597\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u5e94\\u8ba4\\u771f\\u8bc4\\u4f30\\uff0c\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8bca\\u7597\\u6307\\u5f81\\uff0c\\u505a\\u597d\\u4e2a\\u4eba\\u9632\\u62a4\\uff0c\\u4e25\\u683c\\u6267\\u884c\\u6d88\\u6bd2\\u9694\\u79bb\\u89c4\\u8303\\u3002\\u73b0\\u7ed3\\u5408\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u8bca\\u7597\\u7279\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u5236\\u5b9a\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u6d41\\u884c\\u671f\\u95f4\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u4e2d\\u5fc3\\u5e94\\u5bf92019-ncov\\u611f\\u67d3\\u7684\\u9632\\u63a7\\u65b9\\u6848\\uff0c\\u9632\\u6b62\\u533b\\u9662\\u611f\\u67d3\\u53d1\\u751f\\u3002\\u4ee5\\u671f\\u80fd\\u5bf9\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u4e00\\u7ebf\\u533b\\u52a1\\u4eba\\u5458\\u57282019-ncov\\u6d41\\u884c\\u671f\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u53ca\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u9632\\u63a7\\u8d77\\u5230\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4e0e\\u6307\\u5bfc\\u4f5c\\u7528\\u3002.']\",\"['background:

the aim of this study was to identify whether sars-cov-2 infected in ocular surface. methods: cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a covid-19 diagnosis, from december 30, 2019 to february 7, 2020, at tongji hospital, tongji medical college, huazhong university of science and technology. demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (rt), chest computed tomography (ct) were took intermittently, and sars-cov-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. results: a total of 102 patients (48 male [50%] and 54 female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, rt, and chest computed tomography (ct) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of covid-19. patients had a mean [sd] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [sd] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with sars-cov-2 rt-pcr assay. only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed covid-19. however, sars-cov-2 rna fragments was found in ocular discharges by sars-cov-2 rt-pcr only in one patient with conjunctivitis. conclusions: although we suspect the incidence of sars-cov-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of sars-cov-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. the inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of sars-cov-2. therefore, to lower the sars-cov-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers. ###

etiologic agent responsible for covid-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. to better understand viral tropism, we assessed the rna expression of the coronavirus receptor, ace2, as well as the viral s protein priming protease tmprss2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the human cell atlas consortium. we found that ace2, as well as the protease tmprss2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. in-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ace2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. the skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ace2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. this association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the human cell atlas as a reference dataset. in this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 infection. this, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.']\",\"['background: real-time pcr (rt-pcr) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of sars-cov-2. however, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of rt-pcr, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. methods: we explored the feasibility of droplet digital pcr (ddpcr) to detect sars-cov-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with rt-pcr in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical rt-pcr detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. the experiment was double-blind. results: the lower limit of detection of the optimized ddpcr is at least 500 times lower than that of rt-pcr. the overall accuracy of ddpcr for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by rt-pcr were correctly judged by ddpcr based on the follow-up investigation. in addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by rt-pcr were

simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. methods: this study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (lym%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of covid-19 patients. next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in covid-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. results: our results from death and severe cases showed that lym% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of covid-19. lym% in patients with moderate covid-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. in contrast, lym% was lower than 20% in severe cases. however, lym% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. therefore, we established a reliable time from symptom onset-lym% model (tlm), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with covid-19.

(2019-ncov) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. a deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. the estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% ci 5.71\\u20137.23). sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by wuhan on 2019-ncov infection in beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. it is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-ncov infection, and how long they should be maintained. under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 january 2020) with a significant low peak value. with travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.']\",\"['the basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a na\\u00efve, uninfected population. it is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. with the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-ncov need to be revised. by using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until january 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. we estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. the epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.']\",\"['we conducted a comparative study of covid-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland china, the guangdong province of china and south korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. we estimated the initial basic reproduction number for south korea, the guangdong province and mainland china as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (ci): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%ci: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%ci: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. we found that the effective reproduction number for the guangdong province and mainland china has fallen below the threshold 1 since february 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for south korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. we also project the epidemic trend in south korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in china is used. we show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in china and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the covid-19 epidemic in south korea. the experience of outbreak control in mainland china should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including south korea. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding ### author declarations all relevant

due to the spring festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the shaanxi province. the epidemic scale in shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in xian. we could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. this calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the shaanxi province have been effective. risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between january 10th and february 4th 2020. however, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. we believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities

case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in wuhan on december 8, 2019. when wuhan city took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; if wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on january 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on january 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on january 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. if wuhan city is closed for one day, the number of

model the mers outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the portuguese situation, using italian dara. i then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in portugal. in the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people on the 5th of april (out-of-control scenario). if the self-protective and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the south korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario 1). considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios were devised. in all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\\\\\\\\% effectiveness when compared to the measures in

with new cases of covid-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. methods: we developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to covid-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. findings: for fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. for slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. interpretation: handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about covid-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. we stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing covid-19

pathogenesis and vaccine development. large rna virus genomes, such as from coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in e. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability. therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for rna viruses would benefit the research community. here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse rna viruses, including members of the coronaviridae, flaviviridae and paramyxoviridae families. viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral dna, clinical samples, or synthetic dna, and reassembled in one step in saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (tar) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (yac). t7-rna polymerase has been used to generate infectious rna, which was then used to rescue viable virus. based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic sars-cov-2 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic dna fragments. the technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to

the process of chartering flights to repatriate citizens from the epicentre of the outbreak. these flights began on 29th january 2020 and continued throughout february with the last flight returning on 27 th february 2020. in addition to quarantining citizens returning on these flights to prevent any potential secondary transmission after arrival, many countries implemented pcr screening of returning citizens to test for infection. these repatriation flights therefore provide snapshots of the infection prevalence over time and insights into the levels of transmission in wuhan city. we

views, there is growing literature on pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contributing significantly to the disease outbreak. several recent studies on serial infection yielded a mean interval of around 4 days, shorter than the mean symptom onset time of 5-7 days, and negative serial interval in more than 10% of the cases. these observations highlight the urgent need to quantify the pre-symptomatic transmission for adequate global response. in this paper, we develop an epidemic model driven by pre-symptomatic transmission. within the model construct, the infectiousness of a viral carrier on a given day is identified with their symptom onset probability, which we characterise through extensive studies of the clinical literature. the well-known lotka-euler estimating equation can then be invoked to relate the daily growth rate $\\\\\\\\lambda$ of the epidemic with the basic reproduction number $r_0$. we applied the disease spreading model to epidemic development in affected provinces across china following the wuhan lockdown on january 23, 2020. the remarkable three-phase universal pattern can be well-captured by the model. despite its simplicity, the model

with the ace2 binding site within 2019-ncov rbd. therefore, cr3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov infections. interestingly, some of the most potent sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, cr3014) that target the ace2 binding site of sars-cov failed to bind 2019-ncov spike protein, indicating that the difference in the rbd of sars-cov and 2019-ncov has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is

greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. uae, lebanon, and canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from iran in february 2019. we estimated that 18,300

travel to countries with identified cases of covid-19 with origin in iran (such as canada), it is likely that iran is currently experiencing a covid-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. this is concerning, both for public health in iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with

countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. when all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% ci 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on february 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. in sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). we recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. the reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from italy, relative to iran. in summary, we suggest that the numerous covid-19 case exportations from italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in south korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of february 29, 2020. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement funded by canadian institutes for health research covid-19 rapid research fund. ###

report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. the performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging 2019-ncov is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov and, to a lesser degree, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)-cov. moreover, the well-known sars-cov receptor (ace2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of 2019-ncov; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the 2019-ncov, and that domain 288-330 of s1 protein from the 2019-ncov represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.']\",\"['background: a range of case fatality ratio (cfr) estimates for covid 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. methods: we used individual-case data from mainland china and cases detected outside mainland china to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). we next obtained age-stratified estimates of the cfr by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in china, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. we additionally estimated the cfr from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland china. we used data on the pcr prevalence in international residents repatriated from china at the end of january 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (ifr). using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from china, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. findings: we estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, cri 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% cri 21.1,24.4 days). we estimate a crude cfr of 3.67% (95% cri 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland china. adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in wuhan relative to the rest of china, we obtain a best estimate of the cfr in china of 1.38% (95% cri 1.23%,1.53%)

an overall ifr estimate for china of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. interpretation: these early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of covid-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by

reportedly decreased in china and south korea, it still exhibit significant growth in italy and other countries across europe. in this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. instead of the classical sir model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\\\\\\\\mathcal{r}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard sir model. if $\\\\\\\\mathcal{r}_0 >1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. however, if $\\\\\\\\mathcal{r}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. we then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). analysis of the data in china and korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. during this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. however, the growth rate remains exponential in italy. arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.']\",\"['until 24:00 of february 7th 2020, 31774 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection have been reported, including 6101 severe cases in critical conditions and 722 deaths. the critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. it has been recently known that the 2019-ncov shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (sars-cov). thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on sars which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in sars but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-ncov (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. the computerized tomography (ct) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-ncov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-ncov patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (crrt) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

of the virus in mainland china excluding hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. methods: a novel covid-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention

reproduction ratio re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland china excluding hubei province. results: the estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% ci 3.20-3.64) and re(t) has dropped below 1 since january 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the chinese government in mainland china excluding hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed covid-19 transmission. moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. by calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by april, 2020. conclusions: to ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including

epidemiological features of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) outbreak, and evaluated the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic in wuhan, china. methods individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases reported through february 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal notifiable disease report system. based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before january 11, january 11-22, january 23 - february 1, and february 2-18. we compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. we developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. results the median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. the attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate continued to increase. healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. the effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. the interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till february 18. we found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. conclusions considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the covid-19 outbreak in wuhan. special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study was partly supported by the fundamental research

covid-19 outbreak. the data will be used for future reference. methods: from 31 january to 2 february 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. the online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with covid-19, knowledge and concerns about covid-19, precautionary measures against covid-19, and additional information required with respect to covid-19. psychological impact was assessed by the impact of event scale-revised (ies-r), and mental health status was assessed by the depression, anxiety and stress scale (dass-21). results: this study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in china. in total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. most respondents spent 20\\u201324 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting covid-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &lt; 0.05). conclusions: during the initial phase of the covid-19 outbreak in china, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. our

china and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. there is no report about the prevalence of covid-19 in cml patients untill now. we aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of cml patients with covid-19 and prevalence of covid-19 in cml patients. methods in this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of cml patients with covid-19 in each center were collected. simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the cml patients under the management at each center by asking the cml patients to complete a questionnaire,from february 15, 2020 to february 21, 2020. the questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, cml diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have covid-19. we described and analyzed the prevalence of covid-19 in cml patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of covid-19 patients. data were compared between the cml patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. the primary outcome was prevalence of covid-19 in cml patients, as of feb 21, 2020. secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of cml patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of cml patients with covid-19 . findings of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. in the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with covid-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with covid-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with covid-19. of the 50 patients who failed to respond to cml treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of covid-19. interpretation while the 392 cml respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with covid-19 patients during the outbreak. patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to cml therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with sars-cov-2. older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by

information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. objective: to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of ncip. design, setting, and participants: retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed ncip at zhongnan hospital of wuhan university in wuhan, china, from january 1 to january 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was february 3, 2020. exposures: documented ncip. main outcomes and measures: epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. results: of 138 hospitalized patients with ncip, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 \\u00d7 109/l [interquartile range {iqr}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [iqr, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 u/l [iqr, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (icu) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). the median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ards was 8.0 days. patients treated in the icu (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the icu (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). of the 36 cases in the icu, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). as of february 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized.

of the 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) has attracted global attention. in the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two \\\\\\\\``zero\\\" points, respectively. unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. method. to address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two \\\\\\\\``zero\\\" points. then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the covid-19 using the public available data for mainland china beyond hubei province from the china centers for disease control (cdc) during the period of jan 29th, 2020, to feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. results. results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. the first prediction results on jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland china beyond hubei province would appear on jan 31st and feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late march, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-march and mid-april in mainland china beyond hubei province. the framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where covid-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the authors are grateful for the financial support

province, china, in december 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is the receptor for sars-cov and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-ncov. paradoxically, ace2 expression in the lung protects mice from sars-cov spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. in the intestine, ace2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. upon analysis of single cell-rna sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), we found that ace2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. in summary, we suggest that ace2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-ncov infection.competing interest statementthe authors have declared no competing interest.funding statementthe national natural science

patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the department of infectious diseases, renmin hospital of wuhan university from january 14 to february 13, 2020. the recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (ct) scans, and treatment measures. sars-cov-2 rna in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time rt-pcr. findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 covid-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. in addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (crf) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) were confirmed infection of sars-cov-2, and diagnosed as covid-19. beside the treatment of covid-19, crrt was also applied three times weekly. the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of crf, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. all 5 patients with crf were survived. moreover, sars-cov-2 rna in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for sars-cov-2 orf 1ab from 5 cases with crf. interpretation acute renal impairment was uncommon in covid-19. sars-cov-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate crf in the covid-19 patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have

confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by covid-19 in the world from january 20 to february 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in january. then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. results there were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in china and 26 overseas countries. in total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from hubei province. the lgn rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72\\u2103 and then slowly declined. the apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70\\u2103 and 12.42\\u2103 respectively. the curves shared similar shapes. under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1\\u2103 increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. in the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1\\u2103 increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. conclusion the study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change covid-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in wuhan. it is suggested that countries and regions with a

2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. the possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-ncov and co-infections. methods: we used a fluorescence-based quantitative pcr kit urgently distributed by the chinese cdc to detect 8274 close contacts in the wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-ncov genome. we also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-ncov. findings: among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-ncov infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-ncov nucleic acid test (non-019-ncov); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-ncov-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. the positive rates of ncov-np and ncovorf1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. ncov-np-positive only and ncovorf1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. in the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-ncov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza a virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza a h3n2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza a virus (11/202), influenza a h3n2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza b virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). interpretation: clinical testing methods for 2019-ncov require improvement. importantly, 5.8% of 2019-ncov infected and 18.4% of non-2019-ncov-infected patients had other pathogen infections. it is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. a test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) for entering into host cells. the affinity between ace2 and 2019-ncov s is much higher than ace2 binding to sars-cov s protein, explaining that why 2019-ncov seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. here, we reported that ace2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including sars-cov and

covid-19 occurred in wuhan, hubei province, china. in a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over china, greatly threatening public health and economic development. the chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these chinese strategies for controlling the spread of covid-19. methods: from the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial health commission websites of china, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. we further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (speedmax). comparing different times to speedmax of different areas in china, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. also, the number of plateaus were analyzed. results: the quartic model showed the best fit. for almost all areas in mainland china, the speed of infections reached speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were hebei, heilongjiang, hainan, guizhou, and hubei. the number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. however, the distance from other areas to hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at speedmax. once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of covid-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over china. conclusion: our study suggests that chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. these strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the covid-19

assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of covid-19. this enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. findings we estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. for early transmission in wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside wuhan was less

intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. in this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient respiratory simulation model (rsm) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. subsequently, we first apply a gru neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (bi-at-gru) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (eupnea, tachypnea, bradypnea, biots, cheyne-stokes and central-apnea). the proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.']\",\"['severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronaviruses (covs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (s) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. coronavirus s proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 n-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on mers s that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on sars and hku1 covs. we provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including hiv-1 envelope, lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class i viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.']\",\"['the recent epidemic of coronavirus (covid-19) that started in china has already been \\\"exported\\\" to more than 140 countries in all the continents, evolving in most of them by local spreading. in this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until march 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. the data available at the johns hopkins university site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. all the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in china. on the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, italy, iran, and spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other european countries. even more recently, us -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside china (jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. we calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. we identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretations and possible explanations for them. the analysis and conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases, are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.']\",\"['<p>the novel coronavirus outbreak (covid-19) in mainland china has rapidly spread across the globe. within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on december 31, 2019, a total of 566 severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars cov-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in china and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. we estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the covid-19 outbreak. our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single sars cov-2 case from mainland china via international travel exceeded 95% on january 13, 2020. we found that 779 cases (95% ci: 632 to 967) would have been exported by february 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the chinese government averted 70.5% (95% ci: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. in addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% ci: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. at this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the covid-19 outbreak, buying time

of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family coronaviridae , subfamily orthocoronavirinae ) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. while the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. we infer bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. we thus propose that partial rdrp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the r package, \\u201cmycov\\u201d, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. importance statement the analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as coronaviruses. recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. to assist in this, we also provide the r package \\u2018mycov\\u2019 which classifies user generated sequences.']\",\"['objective: establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an online tool to assess

blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. infectious virus was detected by cell culture. active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. results: seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. clinical sensitivity of rt-pcr on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. average viral load was 6.76x10e5 copies per

of 2019n-cov is of great concern to the global community. the fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. during such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. we aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-ncov outbreak. methods an anonymous internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on january 29, 2020. the study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of hubei, where wuhan is the capital city. the level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. findings the majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. a high uptake of 2019-ncov preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [or] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (or = 2.23, 95% ci 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. the majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-cov. few of the participants from wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. similarly, being under quarantine (or = 2.36, 95% ci 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (or = 2.20, 95% ci 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. interpretation the results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. in view of the 2019-ncov being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services. funding national key r&d program of china, ningbo health branding subject fund, sanming project of medicine in shenzhen, k.c. wong magna fund in ningbo university, national natural

development (hr, 1.77; 95% ci, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (hr, 0.41; 95% ci, 0.21-0.82). among patients with ards, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (hr, 0.38; 95% ci, 0.20-0.72). conclusions and relevance older age was associated with greater risk of development of ards and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. although high fever was associated with the development of ards, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ards. moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ards.']\",\"['importance: heart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus. however, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. objective: to explore whether heart injury occurs in covid-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. design, setting, and participants a single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 covid-19 patients admitted from december 25, 2019 to january 27, 2020 in wuhan jinyintan hospital, china; follow up was completed on february 11, 2020. exposures: high levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-tni; ck; ck-mb; ldh; \\u03b1-hbdh). main outcomes and measures: mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). results: of 188 patients with covid-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. increased hs-tni levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). high hs-tni on admission (\\u2265 6.126 pg/ml), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/ml), already can be associated with higher mortality. high hs-tni was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, il-6, crp, and pct) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells). ck was not associated with mortality. increased ck-mb levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. high ck-mb on admission was associated with higher mortality. high ck-mb was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. increased ldh and \\u03b1-hbdh levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. both high ldh and \\u03b1-hbdh on admission were associated with higher mortality. both high ldh and \\u03b1-hbdh were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-tni level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% ci= -0.64~-0.12, p=0.005). ldh level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% ci= -0.59~-0.05, p=0.022). conclusions and relevance: heart injury signs arise in covid-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. covid-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. high levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. covid-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because covid-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury. ### competing interest statement

have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the chinese governments during the outbreaks. by considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-december 2019 to late-april 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. our findings showed that if the covid-19 outbreak occurred only in wuhan city or hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. however, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of china, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. supplies of facemasks in the whole of china would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the covid-19 outbreak only occurred in wuhan city or hubei province. however, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of china, facemask supplies in china could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 apr 2020. assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of april. in light of the covid-19 outbreak in china, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the

reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). cases have been exported to other chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from wuhan to cities outside mainland china and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. methods we used data from dec 31, 2019, to jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from dec 25, 2019, to jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in wuhan from dec 1, 2019, to jan 25, 2020. cases exported domestically were then estimated. we forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-ncov, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of wuhan and surrounding cities, which began jan 23-24, 2020. we used data on monthly flight bookings from the official aviation guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland china from the tencent database. data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the chinese center for disease control and prevention. serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov). a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in china. the basic reproductive number was estimated using markov chain monte carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (cri). findings in our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-ncov was 2\\u00b768 (95% cri 2\\u00b747-2\\u00b786) and that 75 815 individuals (95% cri 37 304-130 330) have been infected in wuhan as of jan 25, 2020. the epidemic doubling time was 6\\u00b74 days (95% cri 5\\u00b78-7\\u00b71). we estimated that in the baseline scenario, chongqing, beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and shenzhen had imported 461 (95% cri 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from wuhan, respectively. if the transmissibility of 2019-ncov were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of china with a lag time behind the wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. interpretation given that 2019-ncov is no longer contained within wuhan, other major chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. large cities overseas with close transport links to china could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. funding health and medical research fund (hong kong, china).']\",\"['background: the covid-19 has been successfully contained in china but is spreading all over the world. we use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in china and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. we use the experience from china to analyze the calibration results on japan, south korea, iran, italy and europe, and make future scenario projections. methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized richards model to the reported number of infected cases from jan. 19 to march 10 for the whole of china, 29 provinces in china, four severely affected countries and europe as a whole. the different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. results: we quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in china with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. based on chinese experience, we identify a high risk in japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of march 25 being 1574 (95% ci: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% ci: [988, 11340]) by june. for south korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% ci: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. we estimate 0.15% (95% ci: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. we would expect 114867 people infected in europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% european population. conclusions: the extreme containment measures implemented by china were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. for other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. japan and italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak

by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has broken out in wuhan, hubei province, china. the continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in china. we managed to forecast the infection peak time in hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. methods: we used data resource according to cases reported by the national health commission of the', \\\"people's\\\", 'republic of china (jan 25, 2019, to feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in wuhan on subsequent days. medical observation, discharge, infected, non-severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in hubei province will occur. also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is april 6-april 14. the numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. results: in very optimistic scenarios (daily ncc decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around february 23-february 26. at the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. in a relative optimistic scenario (daily ncc decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around february 28-march 2. the numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. in a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily ncc decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of march. estimated time is april 6-april 14. the numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. we are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. there should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. in that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. if that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. conclusion: we can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. assisting critical care resources in hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-ncov and sars-cov. further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the spike protein between covid-19 and sars-related cov clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rbd protein sequences. in addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, orf3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between covid-19 and sars-related cov, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. finally, it should be noted that many observed bat sars-like covs that have an evolutionary convergent rbd sequence with 2019-ncov and sars-cov may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ace2, and hence would be potential

branch of sars-cov-2. we classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (c/t type) based on the base (c or t) at positions 8824 and 28247. zj01 were both t at these two sites, becoming the only tt type currently identified in the world. the prediction of furin cleavage site (fcs) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that fcs may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. zj01 had mutations near fcs (f1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the s protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of furin. single cell sequencing and ace2-furin co-expression results confirmed that furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while fcs may help sars-cov-2 infect these organs. the evolutionary pattern of sars-cov-2 towards fcs formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to hku-1 and oc43 (the source of fcs sequence-prra) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild covid-19 subtypes. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this research was supported by the

caused by sars-cov-2 infection in wuhan, china has posed a serious threat to global public health. to develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. therefore, we herein used a sars-cov-2 spike (s) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that sars-cov-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of sars-cov. we solved the x-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-hb) core of the hr1 and hr2 domains in sars-cov-2 s protein s2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the hr1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with hr2 domain. we previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, ek1, which targeted hr1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including sars-cov and mers-cov. we then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the ek1c4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with ic50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nm, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of ek1 peptide, respectively. ek1c4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including sars-cov and mers-cov, as well as sarsr-covs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including sars-cov-2. intranasal application of ek1c4 before or after challenge with hcov-oc43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that ek1c4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating sars-cov-2 and emerging sarsr-covs.']\",\"['background: the ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) in wuhan, china, is arousing international concern. this study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. methods: we collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the chinese local authorities. we evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. all the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. results: the estimated mean incubation period for covid-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [ci], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). the observed mean and standard deviation (sd) of serial interval was 4.1\\u00b13.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. the infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. conclusions: the results indicated the transmission of covid-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no external funding was

unprecedent public health challenges to both china and the rest world. the new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to sars-cov and a newly identified bat coronavirus. while bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-ncov has other hosts is still ambiguous. in this study, one coronavirus isolated from malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-ncov in the e, m, n and s genes, respectively. in particular, the receptor-binding domain of the s protein of the pangolin-cov is virtually identical to that of 2019-ncov, with one amino acid difference. comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-ncov might have originated from the recombination of a pangolin-cov-like virus with a bat-cov-ratg13-like virus. infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the s protein of 2019-ncov. the isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-ncov in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-ncov. the newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a

assays. the latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. however, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (elisa) for specific igm and igg antibodies,

coronavirus (2019-ncov) from jan.23, 2020. the number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. there have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. however, the traditional transmission model, susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (seir) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. thus, the estimating infected populations based on seir model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. then, we provide a new exposed-identified-recovered (eir) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. according to the spread characters of 2019-ncov, we construct a novel eir compartment system dynamics model. this model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. we assume that 2019-ncov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-ncov. then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-ncov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. the epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared. ###

(daa) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new daa drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. thus, host-targeting antiviral (hta) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of dhodh, s312 and s416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various rna viruses, including influenza a virus (h1n1, h3n2, h9n2), zika virus, ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. our results are the first to validate that dhodh is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in dhodh knocking-out cells. we also proposed the drug combination of daa and hta was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that s312 showed more advantageous than oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. notably, s416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an ec50 of 17nm and si value >5882 in sars-cov-2-infected cells so far. this work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (leflunomide/teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to covid-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.']\",\"['background: since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in china, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. however, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (ami) in covid-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. we investigated the clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients with ami and determined the risk factors for ami in them. methods: we analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized covid-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). we collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. results: cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and ami (n=6). all the six ami patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). novel coronavirus pneumonia (ncp) severity was higher in the ami patients than in patients with non-definite ami (p<0.001). all the ami patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. multivariate analyses showed that c-reactive protein (crp) levels, ncp severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac

top-level response nationwide. we developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (o2o) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. methods in this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected covid-19 patients who underwent home isolation in wuhan between january 6 and january 31, 2020. by wechat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. the clinical indications such as fever, muscle soreness, dyspnea and lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. findings the mean(sd) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(\\u22658805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, p<0.04). all inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their ct results at initial diagnosis. the body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. while dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. the lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. interpretation monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. the system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. this type of o2o, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff. ###

a novel coronavirus, known as sars-cov-2, was identified in wuhan, china. the mortality of critical illness was high in wuhan. information about critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 infection outside of wuhan is scarce. we aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 infection in guangdong province. methods in this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (icu) in guangdong province. demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. data were compared between patients with and without intubation. results forty-five critically ill patients with sars-cov-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 icus in guangdong province. the mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. the most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. a total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. as of february 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of icu. conclusions infection with sars-cov-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. compared with critically ill patients infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in guangdong province was relatively low. these data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with sars-cov-2 outside of wuhan. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

dec., 2019. till date, 77,041 confirmed chinese cases have been reported by national health commission of p.r. china with 9,126 critical cases whose survival rate is quite low. meanwhile, covid-19 epidemic emergence within the other countries (e.g., korea, italy, japan and iran) is also remarkable with the increasing spread speed. it plays a more and more important role to efficiently and precisely predict the survival rate for critically ill covid-19 patients as more fatal cases can be targeted interfered in advanced. however, the survival rates of all the present critically ill covid -19 patients are estimated manually from over 300 laboratory and clinical features, which inevitably leads to high misdiagnose and missed-diagnose rate due to lack of experience and priori knowledge. as a remedy, we have developed a machine learning-based prognostic model that precisely predicts the survival for individual severe patients with more than 90% accuracy with clinical data collected from tongji hospital, wuhan. significantly, such model only requires three key clinical features, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (ldh), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hscrp) out of all 300+ features. the rationality of such mere three features may lie in that they are the representatives of tissue injury-, immunity- and inflammation-typed indices, respectively. from the covid-19 patient diagnosis aspect, the work actualizes low-cost and prompt criticality classification and survival prediction before targeted intervening and diagnosis, especially for the triage of the large-scale explosive epidemic covid -19 cases. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement none ### author declarations all relevant

in wuhan, hubei and spread to all provinces in china and other countries. shenzhen ranked the top cities outside wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by february 20, 2020. here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 in shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of covid-19 in shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from january 19 to january 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from january 29 to february 5 and the decline phase since february 6. in the three phases, the number of patients from hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. the newly diagnosed covid-19 cases reached its peak around january 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at shenzhen. a series of early preventive strategies were implemented since january 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in shenzhen. all the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab pcr detection of coronavirus 2019, chest ct and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of covid-19. observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at shenzhen from hubei was implemented in february 2. after the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the covid-19 cases started to decline since february 6. there were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in shenzhen. in conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as covid-19, in nearby province of hubei, shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into shenzhen city. the implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in shenzhen were successful in early identification of covid-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in shenzhen. early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in shenzhen. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work

last follow-up was february 18, 2020. results:we characterized 55 consecutive covid-19 patients. the mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [ci], 6.55-10.29) days. the mean sars-cov-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%ci, 8.21-11.22) days. covid-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. asymptomatic carriers might transmit sars-cov-2.

forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. however, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of covid-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. in this paper, based on the public covid-19 data of seven provinces/cities in china reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. we highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. we further introduce the akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. we further notice the logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the', \\\"gomertz's\\\", 'function makes an overestimation in all cases. since the methods of sequential bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. the transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. towards the dynamical models based on odes, it is observed that the seir-qd and seir-po models generally show a better performance than sir, seir and seir-ahq models on the covid-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the authors acknowledged the financial supports

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) first broke out in wuhan (china) and subsequently spread worldwide. chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating sars-cov-2 infection. hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. we propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill sars-cov-2 infected patients. currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in sars-cov-2 infection. methods: the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using sars-cov-2 infected vero cells. physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (pbpk) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. using the pbpk models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the', \\\"drug's\\\", 'safety profile. results: hydroxychloroquine (ec50=0.72 \\u03bcm) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (ec50=5.47 \\u03bcm) in vitro. based on pbpk models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for sars-cov-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. conclusions: hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit sars-cov-2 in vitro.']\",\"['background: in this article, we summarized the early epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of sars and covid-19 in different countries. aim to provide recommendations for the understanding and prevention of covid-19. methods: by searching pubmed, we analyzed and compared the typical cases of sars and covid-19 in different countries in the early stage of the outbreak. clinical records, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. this paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics and tables and graphs. findings: six sars-related articles (n=337 participants) and 12 covid-19-related articles (n=50,096 participants) were eligible for this systematic review. fever, cough and malaise/fatigue were the most common symptoms in sars and covid-19. but in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of covid-19 were not obvious. compared with sars, covid-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way, from person to person, asymptomatic infected people and possible fecal-oral transmission, created the conditions for a large-scale spread. the mortality rates of sars and covid-19 were (7.7%) and (2.2%) respectively, but the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of covid-19 (3.9%) was lower than that of sars (40.0%). we also summarize the current reports on the pathology of covid-19, we found that the pathological features of covid-19 have greatly similar with sars, which manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). interpretation: the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of sars and covid-19 in china are very similar, but also difference. in general, covid-19 is transmitted in more diverse ways and is more infectious, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker and patient is very important. active and effective isolation measures for suspected and close contacts are necessary. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement none ### author

sars-cov-2 during the ongoing outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan, china. hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the sars-cov-2 for hcws, patients, and visitors. no data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of wuhan. objective to investigate the extent to which sars-cov-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (ppe) in wuhan, china. design a field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the sars-cov-2 rna. setting six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the zhongnan medical center in wuhan, china in the mist of the covid-19 outbreak between february 7 - february 27, 2020. participants dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (ppe). the sars-cov-2 rnas were detected by reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr). main outcomes and measures sars-cov-2 rnas results the most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (ncp) (31.9%), obstetric isolation ward specialized for pregnant women with ncp (28.1%), and isolation ward for ncp (19.6%). we classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. the most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated ppe. conclusions and relevance many surfaces were contaminated with sars-cov-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and ppe. the 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. these findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among hcws during the outbreak of covid-19. the findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of sars-cov-2. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the investigation was

on the pneumonia outbreak caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) were based on information from the general population. however, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) reactivation. this study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the sars-cov-2 reactivation. methods clinical records, laboratory results, and chest ct scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for sars-cov-2) who were admitted to zhongnan hospital of wuhan university, wuhan, china, from jan. 8 to feb. 10, 2020. results all 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to covid-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with sars-cov-2 reactivation. among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. one of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 \\u00d7 109 cells per l) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 \\u00d7 109 cells per l). all 5 reactivated patients presented normal

can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. we focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the chinese lunar new year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (covid-19). we first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. when flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. these movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. we characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 lunar new year due to travel restrictions. travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. these results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level.']\",\"['abstract background the covid-19 epidemic, first emerged in wuhan during december 2019, has spread globally. while the mass population movement for chinese new year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in china. methods', \\\"spearman's\\\", 'correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed covid-19 cases from jan 20th to feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. results there were 74,675 confirmed covid-19 cases in china by feb 19th, 2020. the overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). the index of population inflow from hubei was positively correlated with total (provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; city r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; city r=0.6358, p<0.001). the local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. conclusions the spread of the covid-19 in china in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

p=0.008). severity rates for patients with nlrhiigghi, nlrhiigglo, nlrloigghi, and nlrloigglo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p<0.0001). furthermore, severe patients with nlrhiigghi, nlrhiigglo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including il-2, il-6 and il-10, and decreased cd4+ t cell count compared to those with nlrloigglo phenotype (p<0.05). recovery rate for severe patients with nlrhiigghi, nlrhiigglo, nlrloigghi, and nlrloigglo phenotype was 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p=0.0592). dead cases only occurred in nlrhiigghi and nlrhiigglo phenotypes. interpretation: covid-19 severity is associated with increased igg response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late igg response and nlr could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere covid-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding. ### author declarations all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed;

coronavirus is vital to rapidly control continuous covid-19 spread. we found genomic and evolutionary evidences of the occurrence of 2019-ncov-like coronavirus (named as pangolin-cov) from dead malayan pangolins. pangolin-cov is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-ncov and batcov ratg13, respectively. pangolin-cov is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-ncov and ratg13. the s1 protein of pangolin-cov is much more closely related to 2019-ncov than ratg13. five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ace2 are completely consistent between pangolin-cov and 2019-ncov but four amino-acid mutations occur in ratg13. it indicates pangolin-cov has similar pathogenic potential to 2019-ncov, and would be helpful to trace the origin and probable intermediate host of 2019-ncov.']\",\"['background: an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (covid-19) caused by sars-cov-2 is on-going in china and appears to approach late phase. it is highly

testing have not been fully demonstrated. methods a total of 173 patients with confirmed sars-cov-2 infection were enrolled. their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (ab), igm and igg against sars-cov-2 using immunoassays. the dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. findings among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for ab, igm and igg was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. the seroconversion sequentially appeared for ab, igm and then igg, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. the presence of antibodies was < 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for ab, igm and igg respectively since day 15 after onset. in contrast, the positive rate of rna decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. combining rna and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for covid-19 patients (p < 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). moreover, a higher titer of ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). interpretation the antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of sars-cov-2 infection. the findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of covid-19 patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial not a study of

disease 2019 (covid-19) is rapidly spreading over china and more than 30 countries in last two months. covid-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. we develop a model suqc to adequately characterizes the dynamics of covid-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. the suqc model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan, hubei (excluding wuhan), china (excluding hubei) and four first-tier cities of china. we find that, before january 30, 2020, all these regions except beijing have a reproductive number r>1, and after january 30, all regions have a reproductive number r<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting covid-19. the confirmation rate of wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of hubei (excluding wuhan) and 0.2189 of china (excluding hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. the un-quarantined infected individuals in wuhan on february 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on february 21th, 2020. after fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of covid-19 of wuhan and hubei are around late-march, of china (excluding hubei) around mid-march, and of the four tier-one cities before march 2020. a total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from wuhan, 17,679 from hubei(excluding wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of china (excluding hubei). we suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before march in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen, and before late-march in hubei. the model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as south korea, japan and iran. ### competing

ct findings and the clinical conditions of covid-19 pneumonia. materials and methods. data on 101 cases of covid-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in hunan, china. basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). results. patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. most patients with covid-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (ggo) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed ggo and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). lesions present on ct images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement

resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in china, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-ncov was reported to share the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), with sars-cov. here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell rna-seq technique, we analyzed the ace2 rna expression profile in the normal human lungs. the result indicates that the ace2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type ii alveolar cells (at2). surprisingly, we found that this population of ace2-expressing at2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. a comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the asian male one has an extremely large number of ace2-expressing cells in the lung. this study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-ncov infection disease, and could be

recovered - seafood market (seiarw) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). the susceptible people from wuhan city were divided into different age groups. we used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3:

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) originating from wuhan, china, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. although rt-pcr-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. to address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (pc)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcmnps), and the development of pcmnps-based viral rna extraction method for the sensitive detection of covid-19 causing virus, the sars-cov-2. this method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcmnps-rna complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent rt-pcr reactions. the simplified process can purify viral rna from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. by identifying two different regions (orflab and n gene) of viral rna, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 100,000 copies of sars-cov-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of covid-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.']\",\"['the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection began in december 2019 in wuhan, and rapidly spread to many

affiliated hospital of ustc from jan 21 to feb 16, 2020, hefei, anhui province, china. covid-19 infection was confirmed by real-time rt-pcr of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. of the 75 patients with covid-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to wuhan. common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. the most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (lym%), decreased cd4+ and cd8+ t cell counts, elevated c-reactive protein (crp) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). patients with elevated interleukin 6 (il-6) showed significant decreases in the lym%, cd4+ and cd8+ t cell counts. besides, the percentage of neutrophils, crp, ldh and procalcitonin levels increased significantly. we concluded that covid-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. hematological profiles including lym, ldh, crp and il-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness. antiviral treatment requires a comprehensive and supportive approach. further targeted therapy should be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory

nationwide traffic restrictions and stay at home movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. based on baidu migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g february 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-wuhan region (y). one is the sum travelers from wuhan during january 20 to january 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of covid-19 was confirmed and announced on january 20. the other is the seed cases from wuhan before january 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before january 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. a simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054\\\\\\\\*x1+2.3455\\\\\\\\*x2 (n = 44, r2 = 0.9330, p<10-7). even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by february 27 in non-wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and stay at home movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of covid-19 across china mainland. the strategy adopted by china has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of wuhan and experience from china. efforts of 29 provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against

and has since rapidly spread across china and to the globe. this virus shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining unclear. here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from covid-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-covid-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of covid-19 during its infection of the human body. methods: we analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation distribution in the samples of covid-19 infected patients, and compare the data with those from the pneumonia cases not caused by covid-19. the study enrolled 125 patients, comprising 103 covid-19-infected patients and 22 non-covid-19 pneumonia cases. laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. blood was collected for lymphocyte subsets and cytokines determination by flow cytometry analysis. the differences in biochemical indices and lymphocyte subsets distribution between covid-19-infected and non-covid-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes relating to organ injury in covid-19 infected patients (exclude asymptomatic infected cases). results: we observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (crp, ldh, ast, egfr and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the covid-19-infected and non-covid-19-caused pneumonia cases. correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the covid-19 infected patients. conclusions: the present study indicates significantly different clinical features between covid-19-caused and non-covid-19-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in covid-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (\\\"cytokine storm\\\").

widespread human infections across the globe. while genetically distinct from sars-cov, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (rbd) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), for virus entry. therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (s) glycoprotein of sars-cov in order to aid research on the newly emerged sars-cov-2. here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the s2 subunit of sars-cov s is highly conserved in multiple strains of sars-cov-2. consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) raised against this immunogenic sars-cov fragment were able to recognise the s protein of sars-cov-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. importantly, one of them (mab 1a9) was demonstrated to detect s in sars-cov-2-infected cells. to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mabs targeting the s2 domain of sars-cov can cross-react with sars-cov-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the s2 subunit. these cross-reactive mabs may serve as tools useful for sars-cov-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease covid-19.']\",\"['background: since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) broke out in wuhan, hubei province, china, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to high transmissibility. we managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (ifp) of new cases in south korea, italy, and iran, utilizing the transcendental model from hubei and non-hubei in china. methods: we extracted data from reports released by the national health commission of the', \\\"people's\\\", 'republic of china (dec 31, 2019 to mar 5, 2020) and world health organization (jan 20, 2020 to mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the ifp of new cases in hubei and non-hubei on subsequent days and the data from mar 6 to mar 9 as validation set. new close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the ifp of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in south korean, italy, and iran. also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. results: the optimistic scenario (non-hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in china. matching and fitting with these scenarios, the ifp of time in south korea would be mar 6-mar 12, italy mar 10-mar 24, and iran is mar 10-mar 24. the numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in south korea, 209k in italy, and 226k in iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. there should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. in that case, the ifp will arrive earlier than our estimation. however, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. if that happens, the ifp of increment will be higher than predicted above. conclusion: we can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. with the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of covid-19. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the reported work was supported in part by research

not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2). critically, however, and in a similar manner to hcov-19, rmyn02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike (s) protein. this provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. together, these data suggest that hcov-19 originated from multiple

effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. in this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the hcov-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. phylogenetic analyses of 15 hcov whole genomes reveal that 2019-ncov has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with sars-cov (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic hcovs. specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-ncov are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to sars-cov. using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known hcov-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of hcovs. in addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-hcov repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and hcov-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the complementary exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the hcov-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. in summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for hcovs.competing interest statementthe authors have declared no competing interest.funding statementnaauthor declarationsall relevant ethical guidelines

each city who have travel history to wuhan. this city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to february 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on february 11, 2020. we used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to march 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. we estimated that the total infections in mainland china would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by march 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by february 21. this date can be advanced to february 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to february 26 under pressure of work resuming. except wuhan

laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (hws). we aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on hws at tongji hospital in wuhan, china. methods: we conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of hws via online questionnaires between february 8th and 10th, 2020. we evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by impact of event scale-revised (ies-r), patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), and generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (gad-7), respectively. we also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by tongji hospital. multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. results: we received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) hws reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. women (hazard ratio[hr], 1.31; p=0.032), years of working> 10 years (hr, 2.02; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (hr, 1.51; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (hr, 3.27; p<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (hr, 1.23; p=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [or], 0.76; p=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (or, 0.69; p=0.004) were protective factors. conclusions: women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among hws during the covid-19 pandemic. psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful. ### competing

2019, a novel coronavirus (covid-19) pneumonia hit wuhan, hubei province, china and spread to the rest of china and overseas. the emergence of this virus coincided with the spring festival travel rush in china. it is possible to estimate total number of cases of covid-19 in wuhan, by 23 january 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. methods: we built a model to estimate the total number of cases in wuhan by 23 january 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside wuhan city in china, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in wuhan. we employed population flow data from different sources between wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 january 2020. the number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. findings: from overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% ci: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% ci: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% ci: 4732, 5859) as total cases in wuhan by 23 january 2020, based on different source of data from changjiang daily newspaper, tencent, and baidu. from separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% ci: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% ci: 4659,

epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. however, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. one approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. other approaches use rate equations such as the seir and logistical models. here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. we cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding supported this research ### author declarations all relevant

the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide with over 3,000 deaths since december 2019. there is no cure for covid-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. here we demonstrate a crispr-cas13-based strategy, pac-man (prophylactic antiviral crispr in human cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade sars-cov-2 sequences and live influenza a virus (iav) genome in human lung epithelial cells. we designed and screened a group of crispr rnas (crrnas) targeting conserved viral

worldwide. there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; therefore, the objective of this paper is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against 2019-ncov using immunoinformatics approach. method: we will highlight a technique facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach with comparative genomic approach to determine our potential target for designing the t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-ncov as a target. results: extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in 2019-ncov strain; in addition, 10 mhc1 and mhc2 related peptides were promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99% respectively. conclusion: t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for 2019-ncov using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed t cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine rapidly needs to validates clinically to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to assist on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.']\",\"['global airline networks play a

there were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated c-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (icu), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. the cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time rt-pcr was 96%. one-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest ct scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time rt-pcr results. interpretation most covid-19 patients in xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. the average incubation period was longer among our

improve the performance of anfis by determining the parameters of anfis using fpassa. the fpassa-anfis model is evaluated using the world health organization (who) official data of the outbreak of the covid-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. more so, the fpassa-anfis model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of mean absolute

epidemic of novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency that demands urgent analysis of its genome and solutions for detection and therapy. methods: we used a comparative pangenomic analysis of betacoronavirus sequenced thus far to detect the core and accessory gene clusters of this genus including sars-cov-2. we then annotate the functions, which are confirmed by structural analysis, and predict the potential location within the host cells of these proteins. findings: we found five accessory gene clusters common to the sars clade, including sars-cov-2, that perform functions supporting their pathogenicity. phylogenetic analysis showed one of the accessory gene clusters, the protein e, to be present across the inferred evolutionary pathway of the sars clade, including that of the horseshoe bat virus (hp-betacoronavirus/zhejiang2013), inferred to be the parental member of the clade. the e protein is highly conserved in the clade, differing between sars and sars-cov2 with a difference of single amino acid substitution and a single amino acid insertion present in sars but absent from sars-cov-2. betacoronavirus pangenomedb is available at http://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa. interpretation: the characterization and functional assessment of sars-cov-2 envelope, e, protein in gene cluster 6, together with previous findings on this protein for sars, leads us to recommend that detection of covid-2019 be developed based on the sars-cov-2 e protein and that treatment using mutated sars-cov-2 lacking the e protein be

after it was firstly reported, the novel coronavirus disease covid-19 has already spread worldwide. however, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in china. to assess the effect of

compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. the latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to

to february 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (r0) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. as the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, we have repeated the calculations under a scenario that considers five times the number of confirmed infected cases and eight times the number of recovered. our computations and analysis were based on a mean field

basis of current data and estimations on the official count of infected people in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by february 29; however, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in hubei, china (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals),

variation in climate suitability of sars-cov-2 coronavirus throughout a typical climatological year. the current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with coronavirus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions. the predecessor sars-cov was linked to similar climate conditions. should the spread of sars cov-2 continue to follow current trends, a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic is improbable. more probable is the emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases. people in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of sars cov-2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic and political responses. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ###

for this article: a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia that started in wuhan, china. using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percen-tile). these values should help inform 2019-ncov case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations. early january 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in wuhan, china, where the first cases had their symptom onset in december 2019 [1]. this newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2]. the key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. the range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. the distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3-5] and the transmission potential [6,7]. in absence of data on the 2019-ncov incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of sars or mers coronaviruses. here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from wuhan with confirmed 2019-ncov infection in the early outbreak phase, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates. travellers from wuhan with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, reported symptom onset data and reported travel history in january 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-ncov were detected outside wuhan. for 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 january, the travel history (to and) from wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for four cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. during this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in wuhan. consequently, their time spent in wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in wuhan for a limited time. by taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases. using the duration of stay in wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of possible values for the incubation period of each case. we fitted three parametric forms for the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the weibull distribution, the gamma distribution and the lognormal distribution. we used a bayesian approach to fitting that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. we specified strictly positive flat prior probability distributions']\",\"['since the first case of new coronavirus (2019-ncov) pneumonia appeared in wuhan, the virus has spread very rapidly in china on december 31st, with hubei province having the most severe epidemic situation. as of 24:00 on february 2nd, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in hubei province has reached up to 11,177. in this paper, we select the epidemic situation in hubei province as the research object to establish the seiqdr model of infectious diseases. the parameters are determined from the existing data to predict the trend of the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses, and the parameters are adjusted according to the prevention and control measures as well as possible changes. in comparison with guangdong province, where the sars epidemic originated, it was concluded that the new coronavirus epidemic far exceeds the sars epidemic in terms of infection rate and deaths. but thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the country, currently the epidemic is under control, and we predict the end of the epidemic is about 60 days earlier than the sars virus. the total number of confirmed diagnoses in hubei province is 26,701 (ranges from 24,355 to 32,406), and the rapid growth period is expected to be from january 27th to february 10, and the epidemic will grow

health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of disease. occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. this can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for covid-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. methods: to estimate the burden of united states workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by standard occupational classification) maintained by the bureau of labor statistics (bls) was merged with bls o*net survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. for this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. results: based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 m) of united states workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. approximately 18.4% (26.7 m) of all united states workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. while the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. these include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). conclusions: the large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for covid-19. this work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

progressed to a pandemic with >180,000 cases in >100 countries. reproductive number (r) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. initial r values were published based on the early outbreak in china with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for sars-cov-2. methods: each', \\\"country's\\\", 'covid-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). instantaneous r estimates (wallinga and teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. findings: the country-specific r revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. outside china, r estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. geni scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. interpretation: r was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic r, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. synergistically, geni provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. we calculated an instantaneous country-specific r at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

rapid analysis using nhs health records in 3.8 million adults background: the medical, health service, societal and economic impact of the covid-19 emergency has unknown effects on overall population mortality. previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-covid-19) mortality. we estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different covid-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. methods: using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in england (hdr uk - caliber), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by uk public health england covid-19 guidelines (16 march 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged \\u226530 years from 1997-2017. we used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using icd-10 diagnosis, read, procedure and medication codes. we estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess covid-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (rr) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current phe guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age>70 years and 6.3% aged \\u226470 years with \\u22651 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, copd (0.5%). multimorbidity (co-occurrence of \\u22652 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). the 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age>70 years, 8.6% for copd and 13.1% in those with \\u22653 or more conditions). in a suppression scenario (at sars cov2 rates of 0.001% of the uk population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, rr, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). at sars cov2 rates of 10% of the uk population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at rr 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). at sars cov2 rates of 80% in the uk population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at rr 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. interpretation: we provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from covid-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. if the relative mortality impact of covid-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. however, the relative impact of covid-19 is unknown. if the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. these results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work received no specific

<https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/>']\",\"['background covid-19 is leading to the implementation of social distancing policies around the world and in the united states, including school closures. the evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. there is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. the likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. methods we analyze data from the us current population survey to measure the potential child care obligations for us healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. we account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. we use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a', \\\"patient's\\\", 'covid-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. findings the us healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the united states. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. we document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. for example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. a 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for covid-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. this means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. for school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in covid-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. conclusion school closures come with many tradeoffs. setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce covid-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. the results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ###

the result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with kd of

designed to target viral proteinases. however, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-ncov with an inhibitory potency with kd &lt; 1000 nm. in addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-ncov, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. overall, we suggest that

coronavirus (sars-cov-2) is seriously threatening the public health. the number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for intensive care unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. the mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. to date there is still no available treatment for sars-cov-2. clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (no) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. the time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. we hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled no administered during early phases of covid-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. methods and analysis: this is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic covid-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled no at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. the primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for sars-cov-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. ethics and dissemination: the trial protocol has been approved at the investigation review boards of xijing

risk. findings cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days.

expected to end. conclusions: a wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-ncov. the coming of spring, in addition to the original wuhan-zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central china, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. the pearl river delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south china, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. from a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-ncov transmission before june. ### competing interest statement the

compared and contrasted the mpro for covid-19 with a highly similar sars protein. in spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both

drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. the understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing covid-19 outbreaks. the scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. however, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. in this work a sird compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the chinese and italian outbreaks. exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of hubei province and italy, the model was tuned on the chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the italian outbreak was describe and predicted. with this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing italian epidemic was compensated by the chinese experience, allowing to obtain a sird model for this relatively new covid-19 outbreak. according to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28th of march, with almost 42,000 infected people. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the author received no specific funding for this work. ### author

excluding hubei. we estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in wuhan before the city&#039;s lockdown on january 23, 2020.

has emerged from whuhan, china. rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. china cdc has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th february 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of covid-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to covid-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. we found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of covid-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an or = 18.8161 (ci95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (or=12.8328 ci95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (or=7.7925 ci95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). males are more likely to die from covid-19 (or=1.8518 (ci95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. a final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from covid-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

we carried out an analysis of the time evolution of the infection in different countries, by considering two well-known macroscopic growth laws, the gompertz law and the logistic law. the proposed data analysis permits an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. the daily data must be compared with the obtained fits to verify if the spreading is under control. from our analysis it appears that the spreading is reaching saturation in china and singapore, due to the strong containment policy of the national governments. for south korea and italy, instead, the data of the first week of march on the new infections, will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals. this will show whether a strong containment policy is worth keeping.']\",\"['there is rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as bat coronavirus (bcov) and sars. we confirm high sequence similarity (&gt;99%) between all sequenced 2019-ncovs genomes available, with the closest bcov sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-ncov. despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-ncov genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a serine/leucine variation in the viral orf8-encoded protein. finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.']\",\"['in the night of february 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) was confirmed in the lombardy region, italy. in the week that followed, lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases. we analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the first epidemiological characterization of a covid-19 outbreak in a western country. epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. we collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. we provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval. the epidemic in italy started much earlier than february 20, 2020. at the time of detection of the first covid-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of southern-lombardy. the median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. among these, 18% required intensive care. the mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% ci, 0.7 to 19). we estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% ci, 2.9 to 3.2). we estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around february 20, 2020. we did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. the transmission potential of covid-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. we observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. aggressive containment strategies are required to control covid-19 spread and catastrophic outcomes for the healthcare system.']\",\"['a newly identified coronavirus, 2019-ncov, has been posing significant threats to public health since december 2019. ace2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-ncov infection. interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of sars and 2019-ncov patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ace2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell rna-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. the results indicated that virus might directly bind to ace2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. this finding suggested the liver abnormalities of sars and 2019-ncov patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-ncov patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.']\",\"['a mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in wuhan of china. within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was announced by the world health organization. we performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-ncov infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. overall, the genome of 2019-ncov has 89% nucleotide identity with bat sars-like-covzxc21 and 82% with that of human sars-cov. the phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, spike, envelope, membrane and nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human sars coronaviruses. however, the external subdomain of', \\\"spike's\\\", 'receptor binding domain of 2019-ncov shares only 40% amino acid identity with other sars-related coronaviruses. remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. learning from the roles of civet in sars and camel in mers, hunting for the animal source of 2019-ncov and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage b betacoronavirus. these findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and

patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. no data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. methods: in this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to shenzhen, guangdong province, china, after a visit to wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to wuhan. phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. findings: from jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to wuhan from shenzhen between dec 29, 2019 and jan 4, 2020. of six family members who travelled to wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. additionally, one family member, who did not travel to wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. none of the family members had contacts with wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a wuhan hospital. five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. they presented to our hospital (the university of hong kong-shenzhen hospital, shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. they and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. older patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased c-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. the nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex rt-pcr, but five patients (four adults and the child) were rt-pcr positive for genes encoding the internal rna-dependent rna polymerase and surface spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by sanger sequencing. phylogenetic analysis of these five', \\\"patients'\\\", 'rt-pcr amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (sars)-related coronaviruses found in chinese horseshoe bats. interpretation: our findings are consistent with

research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. however, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. the confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of covid-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between january 20 and march 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over china, 21 cities/ provinces in italy, 21 cities/ provinces in japan, and 51 other countries around

ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. taken chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. the meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2>0.6) with the real data.

of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with sars-cov-2 in wuhan tongji hospital were included from dec 19, 2019 to jan 27, 2020. the immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. results of the 21 patients with covid-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. the average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. pao2/fio2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/l) than moderate cases (11000 million/l). alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 u/l, 567.2 u/l, 135.2 mg/l and 1734.4 ug/l) than moderate cases (17.6 u/l, 234.4 u/l, 51.4 mg/l and 880.2 ug /l). il-2r, tnf-\\u03b1 and il-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/ml, 10.9 pg/ml and 10.9 pg/ml) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/ml, 7.5 pg/ml and 6.6 pg/ml). absolute number of total t lymphocytes, cd4+t cells and cd8+t cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/l) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/l). the expressions of ifn-\\u03b3 by cd4+t cells tended to be lower in severe cases

strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, icu and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. results this study involved 101 covid-19 dead cases in intensive care unit of wuhan jinyintan hospital.47 patients went directly to the icu because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to icu with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by rt-pcr, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.the cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (sd 9.74). the blood type distribution was significantly different, with type a 44.44%, type b 29.29%, type ab 8.08% and type o 18.19%.the clinical manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). neutrophils, pct, crp,il-6,d-dimer gradually increased as time went on.myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% used thymosin preparations. all patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ecmo and 8 patients were treated with crrt.the median time from ards to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(iqr 0.00-6.00). the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days (iqr2.00-8.00). conclusions critical covid-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure with high mortality rate. heart may be the earliest damaged organ except the lungs. secondary infection in the later period is worthy of attention. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial this study was a retrospective study and approved by the ethics committee of wuhan

china, at the end of 2019. although 2019-ncov can cause a severe respiratory illness like sars and mers, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-ncov is generally less pathogenic than sars-cov, and much less than mers-cov. the transmissibility of 2019-ncov is still debated and needs to be further assessed. to avoid the 2019-ncov outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, china activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. here, the current knowledge in 2019-ncov pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.']\",\"['background studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. we investigated the temporal progression in patients with covid-19. methods in this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of covid-19 from jan 20 to feb 6, 2020 in shanghai. final date of follow-up was february 25, 2020. results of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. the duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. a total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. the estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [cis]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. patients who were transferred to intensive care units (icu) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in icu (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, p<0.0001). radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. the median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase pcr tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 cis: 10-12 days). viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in icu than those not in icu (p<0.0001). in multivariate logistical analysis, age (odds ratio [or]=1.06) and cd4 t cell count (or=0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with icu admission. conclusions the majority of covid-19 cases are mild. the clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of cvoid-19.']\",\"['background: computed tomography (ct) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing 2019 novel coronavirus (covid19) pneumonia. our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting covid-19 pneumonia on high resolution ct, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. methods: for model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed covid-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in renmin hospital of wuhan university (wuhan, hubei province, china) were retrospectively collected and processed. twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing ct scans in feb, 5, 2020 in renmin hospital of wuhan university were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-cov pneumonia with that of the model. findings: the model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, ppv of 84.62%, and npv of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, ppv of 88.37%, and npv of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. for 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. with the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. conclusion: the

that sells seafood as well as live exotic animals. we investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. the two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mngs) approach on rna extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf). it rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-ncov according to world health organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total rna sequenced). the entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (genbank mn988668 and mn988669, sequence read archive database bioproject accession prjna601736) and is classified into beta-coronavirus genus. phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-ncov is close to coronaviruses (covs) circulating in rhinolophus (horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial rdrp gene of bat coronavirus strain btcov/4991 (genbank kp876546, 370 nt sequence of rdrp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21. evolutionary analysis based on orf1a/1b, s, and n genes also suggests 2019-ncov is more likely a novel cov independently introduced from animals to humans.']\",\"['objective: the novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) was first reported in wuhan, china in december 2019 and is now pandemic all over the world. previous study has reported several covid-19 cases with conjunctivitis. however, the complete profiling of covid-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. we aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of covid-19 patients. methods: a total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at mobile cabin hospital and tongji hospital. we collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and sars-cov-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by rt-pcr from questionnaires and electronic medical records. results: the median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at mobile cabin hospital and tongji hospital, respectively. of 534 covid-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. the average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 \\u00b1 2.6 days (mean [sd]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three covid-19 related ocular symptoms. notably, a total of 332 covid-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. we also found that some covid-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). in consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. patients, 60.5% in mobile cabin hospital and 67.5% in tongji hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive sars-cov-2 detection. conclusions: conjunctival congestion was one of the covid-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. it is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of covid-19. further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for covid-19 control. ###

december, 2019, a pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) emerged in wuhan, china. we aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-ncov pneumonia. methods: in this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-ncov in wuhan jinyintan hospital from jan 1 to jan 20, 2020. cases were confirmed by real-time rt-pcr and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. outcomes were followed up until jan 25, 2020. findings: of the 99 patients with 2019-ncov pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the huanan seafood market. the average age of the patients was 55\\u00b75 years (sd 13\\u00b71), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-ncov was detected in all patients by real-time rt-pcr. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). according to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. interpretation: the 2019-ncov infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. in general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the mulbsta score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the mulbsta score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-ncov infection. funding: national

structural information of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. herein, we have determined the crystal structure of the n-terminal rna binding domain of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein. although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein n-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. further comparison with mild virus type hcov-oc43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential rna binding pocket alongside the beta-sheet core. complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein n-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to sars-cov-2.']\",\"['as reported by the world

respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum sars-cov-2 nucleic acid (rnaaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the covid-19 patients. however, it is not clear that if the incidence of rnaaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. methods: this study enrolled 48 patients with covid-19 admitted to the general hospital of central theater command, pla, a designated hospital in wuhan, china. the patients were divided into three groups according to the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia (version 6) published by the national health commission of china. the clinical and laboratory data were collected. the serum viral load detection and serum il-6 levels were determined. except for routine statistical analysis, generalized linear models (glms) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time rt-pcr ct value. findings: the result showed that cases with rnaaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. further more, the inflammatory cytokine il-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. more importantly, the extremely high il-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of rnaaemia (r=0.902) and the vital signs of covid-19 patients (r= -0.682). interpretation: serum sars-cov-2 viral load (rnaaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of covid-19 patients. moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine il-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by grants from the

before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. methods: the officially reported cases of 2019-ncov pneumonia were collected as of january 30, 2020. time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with arcgis and winbugs. population migration data of wuhan city and hubei province were extracted from baidu qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. findings: the 2019-ncov pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in hubei and other provinces of south china. hot spot provinces included sichuan and yunnan provinces that are adjacent to hubei. while wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. the case numbers of different provinces and cities of hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from wuhan. lockdown of 19 cities of hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. interpretation: population emigrated from wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. due to the upcoming spring festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness

outbreak remain largely unknown as it is still in its early stage. as many aspects of the new virus are similar to sars in 2003, knowledge, patterns and lessons of the sars-cov outbreak are valuable resources for responding to the wuhan 2019-ncov outbreak. using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the sars outbreak, we assessed and compared the characteristics of those two outbreaks and predicted the possible outcome for the current 2019-ncov outbreak. like the sars-cov, the 2019-ncov has a high human-to-human transmission capability and healthcare workers and family members are high risk populations. because the early outbreak stage coincides with the chinese spring festival travel rush, it is a challenge to prevent and control the spread of the virus. in this situation, the emergence and movement of a 2019-ncov super-spreader is difficult to identify. using the reported case data so far (as of jan 23, 2019), a logistic model was built and the cumulative and daily counts of the 2019-ncov cases were predicted. the cumulative counts of 2019-ncov cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of sars, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle february. regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent emergence and movement of a super-spreader. there is an urgent need to establish enhanced surveillance and implement efficient measures nationwide to control this epidemic.']\",\"['background with the emergence of 4rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus

results of patients suffering from covid-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. results of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from january 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from january 23 to 29. patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21

impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is limited. this study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized covid-19 patients in wuhan. method: we conducted a consecutive cohort study of covid-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in wuhan in 2020. hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. incidence rate for acute kidney injury (aki) was examined during the study period. association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. results: we included 710 consecutive covid19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. the median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. on admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. during the study period, aki occurred in 3.2% patients. kaplan-meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, aki, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. conclusion: the prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized covid-19 patients was high. after adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney impairment in hospitalized covid-19 patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

coronavirus and bat sars-like coronaviruses. the outbreak was initially detected in wuhan, a major city of china, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of china. travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. methods: we developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription pcr assays to detect two different regions (orf1b and n) of the viral genome. the primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as sars coronavirus. these assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and

previously unaffected country. design: simulation study setting: countries with no sustained sars-cov-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions participants: infected air travellers interventions: syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival & traveller sensitisation to the covid-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset. main outcome measures: the achievable delay until a major local outbreak is likely to occur results: we evaluated traveller sensitisation effectiveness in reducing the number of secondary cases of 30, 50 and 70%, and assumed either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. for 50% sensitisation effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 7 days). the possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher r0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance outbreak delays. in combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. in 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 111 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 23 days) for 1 infected traveller per week and at least 9 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 4 days) for 10 infected travellers per week. conclusion: air-traveller targeted interventions, particularly in combination, can delay local sars-cov-2 outbreaks in the magnitude of a few weeks to potentially even months if the number of infected travellers remains low. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement sf and sc are supported by a sir henry

three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in australia. scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter australia, but not tourists. we used disease incidence data from china and air travel passenger movements between china and australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. we estimated the true incidence of disease in china using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. we used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. the modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. the modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on march 6th in australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. the modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on february the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. the impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the covid-19 epidemic in australia and averted a much larger epidemic. the epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. this research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the covid-19 epidemic. ### competing interest statement the authors are employees of a university, and one of

and reduce local transmission of covid-19 in hong kong, and there have been major changes in behaviours of the general public. we examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of covid-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with covid-19. methods: we reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on january 20-23 and february 11-14. we analysed data on laboratory-confirmed covid-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. we estimated the daily effective reproduction number (r_t), for covid-19 and influenza a(h1n1). findings: covid-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late january, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, ci: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% ci: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. in the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. implications: containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of covid-19. the social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early february 2020. however, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as covid-19 continues to spread globally. funding: health and medical research fund, hong kong ### competing interest statement bjc reports honoraria from sanofi pasteur and roche. the

reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based

have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in england. methods: we adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of covid-19 in england and wales. we used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in china. results: we predict that a covid-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in england and wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from february, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in june. the starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. discussion: we provide initial estimates of the potential course of covid-19 in england and wales in the absence of control measures. these results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare

accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the cfr among detected cases. results of 12,863 cases reported outside hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. the deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p<0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. older age (or 1.18 per year; 95%ci: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (or 2.02; 95%ci: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., west and northeast vs. east, or 3.93; 95%ci: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. the estimated cfr was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. the fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. conclusions our estimates of cfr based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of hubei suggest that covid-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and middle east respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. the fatality risk of covid-19 is higher in males and increases with age. our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the covid-19 outbreak response in china and beyond. ### competing interest statement h.y. has

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), emerged in china. despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. sars-cov-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. the efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. in the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against sars-cov-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including sars-cov-1. preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of covid-19 in china have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the sars-cov-2 replication cycle.']\",\"['background the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a newly emerged infection from the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether sars-cov-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. methods we conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr), plasma creatinine, and urea concentrations along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19 admitted to a hospital in wuhan from january 17, 2020 to march 3, 2020. kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin (h&e) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (np) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. results among these 85 covid-19 cases, 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (arf), and elder patients (\\u2265 60 years old) are easier to develop arf (65.22% vs 24.19%, p< 0.001). comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed arf (69.57% vs 11.29%, p< 0.001). dynamic observation of egfr revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of egfr but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. on the other hand, enhancement of egfr and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. h&e staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology or tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration. immunohistochemistry showed that sars-cov-2 np antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. conclusions the development of arf during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with covid-19. sars-cov-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage, arf and probably also lead to urine transmission. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) has posed great threat to human health, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern (pheic) by the who. t cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in covid-19 patients remain largely unclear. methods we retrospectively reviewed the counts of total t cells, cd4+, cd8+ t cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed covid-19, admitted into two hospitals in wuhan from december 2019 to january 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. in addition, the expression of t cell exhaustion markers pd-1 and tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 covid-19 cases. results the number of total t cells, cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were dramatically reduced in covid-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (\\u226560 years of age) and in patients requiring intensive care unit (icu) care. counts of total t cells, cd8+t cells or cd4+t cells lower than 800/\\u03bcl, 300/\\u03bcl, or 400/\\u03bcl, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. statistical analysis demonstrated that t cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum il-6, il-10 and tnf-\\u03b1 concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced il-6, il-10 and tnf-\\u03b1 concentrations and restored t cell counts. finally, t cells from covid-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker pd-1 as compared to health controls. moreover, increasing pd-1 and tim-3 expression on t cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of t cell exhaustion. conclusions t cell counts are reduced significantly in covid-19 patients, and the surviving t cells appear functionally exhausted. non-icu patients, with total t cells, cd8+t cells cd4+t cells counts lower than 800/\\u03bcl, 300/\\u03bcl, and 400/\\u03bcl, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further

of worldwide concern. however, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. this study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of covid-19. the ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. after simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. when j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. this method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic. ### competing

on the epidemic and disease control of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), in order to provide insight for making differentiated controlling policies. methods we collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed covid-19 cases in hefei and shenzhen between january 19 and february 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). from these data we calculated basic reproduction number r0 to reflect the rate of spread of covid-19 in these cities. aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from baidu migration. the change of r0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. spearman correlation analysis between r0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. results a total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in hefei by 24:00 february 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4\\u00b115.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15\\u00b117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (hefei vs shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). before january 31 2020, during the initial stage of the level 1 response to major public health emergencies, there was no significant association observed in shenzhen between r0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (p =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in hefei, such association was strong (p =0.000, r=1.0). however, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. a weak association was observed in shenzhen between be r0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (p=0.073, r=0.536) but not in hefei (p =0.498, r=0.217). conclusion following level 1 response, consistent decline of r0 of covid-19 was observed in both hefei and shenzhen. different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. this indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.

thousand cases and over one thousand death so far.']\",\"['detailed genomic and structure-based analysis of a new coronavirus, namely 2019-ncov, showed that the new virus is a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically fairly distant from the human sars coronavirus. structure analysis of the spike (s) protein of this new virus showed that its s protein only binds weakly to the ace2 receptor on human cells whereas the human sars coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ace receptor. these findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection. these data are important to guide design of infection control policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-ncov when results of direct laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.']\",\"['we present case fatality ratio (cfr) estimates for three strata of 2019-ncov infections. for cases detected in hubei, we estimate the cfr to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). for cases detected in travellers outside mainland china, we obtain central estimates of the cfr in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in wuhan at the end of january derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to japan and germany, we adjusted the estimates of cfr from either the early epidemic in hubei province, or from cases reported outside mainland china, to obtain estimates of the overall cfr in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). it is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. cfrs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. all cfr estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland china is unclear. furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the cfr estimates.']\",\"['governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the covid-19 pandemic. because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. we examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in italy and south korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. this powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for covid-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. we also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting. ### competing

conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on covid-19 through multiple databases. two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. data on clinical characteristics of covid-19 were extracted and analyzed. results seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of covid-19 were included. a total of 3470 covid-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. the most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. there were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest ct scan. laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of c-reactive protein (crp). a total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (icu) while the overall case fatality rate (cfr) was 3.7%. compared to patients admitted outside of hubei, china, those from hubei had a significant higher icu admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001). also, cfr attributed to covid-19 was significantly higher in hubei than that of non-hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001). interpretation this large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the covid-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. dynamic evolvements of covid-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this systematic review

people across 26 countries and claimed 1666 lives. 2019-ncov is a novel form of coronavirus that causes covid-19 and has high similarity with sars-cov. no approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-ncov or any form of coronavirus. here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-ncov t-cell and b-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. these epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. we identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human mhc-i and mhc-ii alleles, and two potential neutralizing b-cell epitopes near the 2019-ncov spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. these mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good mhc-i presentation scores (p=0.02). no mutations are

china, has caused over 74000 infection cases and 2000 deaths. due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of sars-cov-2. in the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic b-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (hla) restricted t-cell epitopes. a total of 61 b-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 t-cell epitopes were predicted that showed affinity with the 34 most popular hla alleles in chinese population. based on these epitopes, 30 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. majority of vaccine peptides contained both b-cell and t-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent hla alleles accounting for ~99% of chinese population. docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of epitopes with their corresponding hla alleles. in conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine.']\",\"['objective: to determine the predictive value of ct and clinical characteristics for short-term disease progression in patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (ncp). materials and methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) infection outside wuhan who had chest ct examinations were retrospectively screened. clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. ct images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. all included patients with moderate ncp were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe ncp (progressive group) or not (stable group). ct and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe ncp. results: a total of 141 patients with moderate ncp were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe ncp during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (nlr) (odds ratio [or] and 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; p = 0.018) and ct severity score (or and 95% ci, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; p = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe ncp, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. however, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on ct between imported and nonimported patients (all p > 0.05). patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between ct severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all p < 0.05). conclusion: ct severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher nlr and ct severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with ncp outside wuhan. furthermore, early admission and surveillance by ct should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding was provided for this study. ### author

contact network to inform them that they are at risk of being infected, and thus allow them to take appropriate social distancing and testing measures. the aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains r\\\\u200b<\\\\u200b1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. first we quantify the parameters of covid-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (r\\\\u200b<\\\\u200b1). with the emergence of the novel viral pathogen sars-cov-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. we come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. we show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

international interest (phei). objectives: the aim of this study is to assess the impact of a covid-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of sao paulo, brazil. methods: we used a generalized seir (susceptibles, exposed, infectious, recovered) model, with additional hospitalized variables (seihr model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of sao paulo. the model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by covid-19. in order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed monte carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. results: we estimate 1 368 (iqr: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the

the novel coronavirus epidemic since december 2019, governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions under high uncertainty at their best efforts. composite monte-carlo (cmc) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. for instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in china are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. hence a cmc is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a cmc, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. in this paper, a case study of using cmc that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a mc which is a common practice, a deep learning-based cmc is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. as a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted mc outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the

boltzmann-function based regression analyses. we found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from jan 21 to feb 14, 2020 for mainland china, hubei province, wuhan city and other provinces were all well fitted with the boltzmann function (r2 being close to 0.999). the potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (ci) as

descriptive results recently reported by the chinese cdc, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in china, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in china aged 22 to 59 years. results among the infected chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (feb 1 to 11). across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by hubei province (10.4%), and the rest of china

have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by sars-cov-2 infection. further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of cvl218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by sars-cov-2 infection. moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that cvl218 may bind to the n-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (n) protein of sars-cov-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. we also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of parp1 inhibitors against sars-cov-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the

and is causing outbreaks in multiple world countries, soon becoming a pandemic. italy has now become the most hit country outside of asia: on march 16, 2020, the italian civil protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for sars-cov-2. in the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. this paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. the distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even intensive care unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. we show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. simulation results are compared with real data on the covid-19 epidemic in italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.']\",\"['the 2019-ncov

its first introduction in china focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of chinese tourists arrived in italy on 23(rd) january 2020 and labeled as coronavirus italian cases. a maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-ncov plus 2 closely related bat strains (sars-like cov) available in genebank. bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in beast 1.10.4. the bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 ncov firstly introduced in wuhan on the 25th november 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including europe and italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th january 2020, the same that the chinese tourists arrived in italy. strains isolated outside china were intermixed with strains isolated in china as evidence of likely imported cases in rome, italy and europe, as well. in conclusion, this report suggests that further spread

useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.']\",\"['recently emerged', \\\"wuhan's\\\", 'novel coronavirus

coronavirus known as covid-19 is rapidly spreading since december 2019. without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the covid-19 virus in china and compare it to other global locations. our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from hubei resembling a', \\\"l\\\\\\\\'{e}vy\\\", 'flight which is characteristic of human mobility. our results also suggest that the disease spread in a city in china is characterized by two-stages process. at early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is almost constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. these two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in china and in other world-wide locations. while most chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control.']\",\"['infection with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, airborne transmission and direct contact. however, conducting bronchoscopy on patients

characteristics of bronchoscopy, it is necessary to formulate the procedure, requirements and precautions when conducting bronchoscopy in the current epidemic situation. relevant standards for preventing from infections should be strictly implemented in the operation of bronchoscopy. it needs to emphasize that bronchoscopy should not be used as a routine means for the diagnosis of 2019-ncov

to identify viral host origins and evolutionary trends, however similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. in this study, global correspondence analysis (ca), within-group correspondence analysis

patients. data were collected from november 21st, 2019 to january 31st, 2020. main outcomes and measures: epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. the disease severity was categorized based on the american thoracic society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. the primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (icu), or invasive ventilation, or death. the risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with covid-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. results: of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of wuhan city. severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at

cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis b infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all p<0.05). after adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with copd (hr 2.681, 95%ci 1.424-5.048), diabetes (hr 1.59, 95%ci 1.03-2.45), hypertension (hr 1.58, 95%ci 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (hr 3.50, 95%ci 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. as compared with patients without comorbidity, the hr (95%ci) was 1.79 (95%ci 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%ci 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. conclusion: comorbidities

2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) emphasizes the importance of detecting novel viruses and predicting their risks of infecting people. in this report, we introduced the vhp (virus host prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. our prediction suggests that 2019-ncov has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), bat sars-like coronaviruses and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). based on our prediction, compared to the coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-ncovs. furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-ncov. these consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of

time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland china. a simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of covid-19. furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of covid-19 in hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in beijing, which was obtained from the ministry of public health of china in 2003. results the feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (r-square>0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. by comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both covid-19 and sars. while all three population groups of sars are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of covid-19. conclusions our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland china very well. despite the virus caused sars (sars-cov) and the virus caused covid-19 (sars-cov-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. the duration of the outbreak would be shorter for covid-19. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study is sponsored by the national

an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19). it is being treated as a class a infectious disease though it was classified as class b according to the infectious disease prevention act of china. accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. however, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of covid-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. the accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the wuhan regions. in this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of covid-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the wuhan regions. methods: we acquired and collected officially reported covid-19 data from 10 regions in china except for hubei province. to achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. we excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. we proposed a monte caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of covid-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. we also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. result: the incubation period of covid-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, weibull, and gamma distributions. we estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed monte carlo simulations. we found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. the former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. it further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of covid-19 along with previous

wuhan in the hubei province. with the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. the spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. previous studies showed that 2019-ncov is highly homologous to human sars-cov and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (rbd) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme ii (ace2). however, the molecular mechanisms of 2019- ncov binding to human ace2 and evolution of 2019-ncov remain unclear. in this study, we have extensively studied the rbd-ace2 complex, spike protein, and free rbd systems of 2019-ncov and sars-cov using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (md) simulations. it was shown that the rbd-ace2 binding free energy for 2019-ncov is significantly lower than that for sars-cov, which is consistent the fact that 2019-ncov is much more infectious than sars-cov. in addition, the spike protein of 2019-ncov shows a significantly lower free energy than that of sars-cov, suggesting that 2019-ncov is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than sars-cov. this may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-ncov because sars-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. it was also revealed that the rbd of 2019-ncov is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ace2, compared to the rbd of sars-cov. that means that 2019-ncov will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than sars-cov. with the rising temperature, 2019-ncov is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than sars-cov, and get controlled more easily. the present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-ncov.']\",\"['we report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients and modelled covid-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample

suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. moreover, based on the expression of ace2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-ncov. analyzing the ace2 in sars-cov infected cells suggested that ace2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation,

exceedingly helpful to ensure effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. therefore, it is critical to quantify illness and fatality risk of covid-19 for the general public. in this report, we investigate the illness and fatality risk of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 mortality cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in china. our result shows a relatively low illness risk for young people but a very high fatality risk for seniors. notably, fatality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. ### competing interest statement the authors

most common and most commonly misapplied numbers in public health. nevertheless, estimating $r_0$ for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $r_0$. here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of $r_0$ and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. to facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($r_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-ncov, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-ncov from 5-40\\\\\\\\% of susceptible individuals. taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $r_0$ when predicting epidemic size.']\",\"['background: to assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-ncov. methods: we developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-ncov outbreak. we used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 ncov-like pathogen. we considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number r0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. we assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. we measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. findings: while simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, r0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher r0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an r0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. for r0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. the delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of r0. for higher values of r0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. interpretation: we found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-ncov within three months. the probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. this model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts. ### competing

is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. to elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with covid-19 methods: in this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. pediatric cases of covid-19 were defined as patients \\u226419 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. the primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. results: a total of 82 patients were included. the median age was 10 [iqr: 5-15] years. patients from mainland china (outside hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. a male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside china) (p=0.22). while the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in china rapidly decreased from the start point. the median reporting delay was 3 [iqr: 2-4.8] days. the median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [iqr: 0-3.25] day. in international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in china (p=0.04). when clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). conclusions: the number of reported international pediatric covid-19 cases is rapidly increasing. covid-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of china. crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with covid-19. further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children. ### competing

on health care professionals recognition of symptoms manifesting in infectious individuals. early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. however, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. methods: we extend the deterministic seir (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. in particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: self-monitoring and reporting (baseline seir model), quarantining the entire population, quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). we further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. results: for all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. the cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. conclusions: our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial no clinical trial conducted ### funding statement this work is funded by the

in this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. the basic reproductive ratio ( r ) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from china to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. this allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from china. we predict that r will be highest across eastern europe and japan, and lowest across africa, central america and south-western asia. this pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.

parts of the world. many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). for those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. however, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. we have developed an \\u201ceasy-to-use\\u201d mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. using the top 10 visiting cities from wuhan in china as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number r = 2.92 and latent period \\u03c4 = 5.2 days. next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low r (1.4), if the r is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. this suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. the study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the

novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19) caused thousands of deaths worldwide, and the number of total infections is still rising. however, the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few months. thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that can be used immediately. fortunately, some compounds that can inhibit coronavirus in vitro have been reported. in this study, the coronavirus-specific dataset was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-task deep model. next we used the re-trained model to select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of sars-cov-2. the results show that abacavir, a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat hiv, is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of sars-cov-2. almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitory effect. overall, ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the important sites for these binding by our model are exhibited. we hope these results would be useful in the fight against sars-cov-2.']\",\"['the detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) diagnosis. since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 \\u2103 prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of sars-cov-2 antibodies is still unclear. by comparing the levels of sars-cov-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 \\u2103 for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to sars-cov-2. the igm levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from covid-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. the igg levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. similar changes can also be observed in the non-covid-19 diseases group (n=9). of note, 44.12% of the detected igm levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 \\u2103 for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to sars-cov-2. heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating. ### competing interest statement the authors have

limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. this study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic covid-19 virus carriers. methods: epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of covid-19 patients (or suspected patients) in nanjing, jiangsu province, china, from jan 28 to feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the covid-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest ct scans were reviewed. findings: none of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical ct images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. the remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal ct image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. these seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; p = 0.012) than the rest. none of the 24 cases developed severe covid-19 pneumonia or died. the median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe covid-19 pneumonia. interpretation: the asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. however, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. these results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged. ### competing interest

by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.']\",\"['in the end of 2019, the epidemic of a new coronavirus (sars-cov-2) occurred in wuhan and spread rapidly. changsha, a city located south to the epicenter, was soon impacted. to control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. this retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that covid-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the section a designated for rapid detection and quarantine. on the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the section b for patients without obvious epidemiological history. eight covid-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. more than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for sars-cov-2 infection. of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a covid-19 case. of the eight covid-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice. while sars-cov-2 epidemic is being alerted in many countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of covid-19 cases and controlling the transmission of the disease. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement we thank

have been more than 76,000 cases of covid-19 in china, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. due to covid-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. methods: this study conducted an online questionnaire survey from february 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in anhui province. this study used a modified brief cope (carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. results: the results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. the closer covid-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. compared with nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use problem-focused coping. people may have a cycle of \\\"the more fear, the more problem-focused coping\\\". and people may \\\"the more angry, the more emotion-focused coping\\\", \\\"the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness\\\".

and 2019/2020 wuhan respiratory syndrome clearly indicate that genome evolution of an animal coronavirus (cov) may enable it to acquire human transmission ability, and thereby to cause serious threats to global public health. it is widely accepted that cov human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (s-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of covs. however, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-ncov s-protein receptor-binding domain (s-rbd) with human receptor ace2, based on experimental sars-cov s-rbd-ace2 complex structure. by sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with monte carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-ncov via comparison with sars-cov. our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of sars-cov, supporting that 2019-ncov may cause human transmission similar to that of sars-cov. thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged cov and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.']\",\"['background: china has been severely affected by covid-19 (corona virus disease 2019) since december, 2019. this study aimed to assess the

coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition. methods: in this study, the covid-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (glucose regulated protein 78 (grp78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. the covid-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the sars spike. results: sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic pep42. protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the grp78 substrate binding domain \\u03b2 (sbd\\u03b2). the docking pose revealed the involvement of the sbd\\u03b2 of grp78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor. conclusions: we reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions iii (c391-c525) and iv (c480-c488) of the spike protein model and grp78. region iv is the main driving force for grp78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. these nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against covid-19.']\",\"['note: this is an extended version of an analysis previously shared with who, governments and academic networks between 22/1/20-24/1/20 summary self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in wuhan. we estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18 th january 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. this implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. it is likely, based on the experience of sars and mers-cov, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-ncov is highly variable-with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in china and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. in the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. it is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within china; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.']\",\"['ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) began in december 2019 in wuhan, china, and

conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks at a community outside china. simulations using stochastic seir model was conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% cri 990-1,000) at day 100 and maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% cri 232-478). calculated mean basic reproductive number (r0) was 6.5 (interquartile range, iqr 5.6-7.2). however, with good case scenarios with

widespread school and workplace closures. we assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. methods: residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. results: disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase. conclusion: high-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak. ### competing interest statement michael l. jackson has received grant funding from sanofi pasteur, unrelated to the present work. janet a. englund is a

emergency of international concern. the clinical spectrum of covid\\u221219 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. it has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. however, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of covid\\u221219 severity. method this study was prospectively registered on prospero. a literature search was performed in three databases (medline, embase and global health) for studies indexed up to 5th march 2020. two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. quality appraisal of studies was performed using the strobe checklist. random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe covid\\u221219 infection or icu admission. results of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 covid\\u221219 patients) were chosen for inclusion. the icu group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-icu group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (por 3.70, 95% ci 1.83 \\u2212 7.46) and icu admission (por 6.55, 95% ci 4.28 \\u2212 10.0). notwithstanding the low prevalence of copd in severe disease and icu-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), copd was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (por 6.42, 95% ci 2.44 \\u2212 16.9) and icu admission (por 17.8, 95% ci 6.56 \\u2212 48.2). cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and icu admission. those with cvd and hypertension were 4.4 (95% ci 2.64 \\u2212 7.47) and 3.7 (95% ci 2.22 \\u2212 5.99) times more likely to have an icu admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. conclusions dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and icu admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. when looking at icu-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, copd patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. to aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with covid\\u221219. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest.

the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over february 4-15. from february 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on february 18 and 19. such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in hubei. implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., jiangxi, henan and anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-ncov. ### competing

reminiscent of the sars outbreak seventeen years ago. we aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both covid-19 and sars, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. methods: we extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of covid-19 in wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in china. we also analyzed the data of 524 patients with sars, including 139 deaths, from beijing city in early 2003. results: older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both covid-19 and sars. the percentages of older age (\\u226565 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both covid-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, p<0.001) and sars (37.4 vs. 4.9, p<0.001). in the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (p=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. in the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with covid-19. meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of covid-19. however, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, p=0.015). the gender role in mortality was also observed in sars patients. survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% ci] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, p= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with sars. conclusion: older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with covid. while men and women have the same susceptibility to both sars-cov-2 and sars-cov, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the covid-19 main protease (mpro). mpro is a key coronavirus enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus. here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, n3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of covid-19 mpro in complex with this compound. next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of mpro. seven of these inhibit mpro with ic50 values ranging from 0.48 to 16.62 \\u03bcm. ebselen, thiadiazolidinone-8 (tdzd-8) and n3 also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. our results demonstrate the efficacy of this

available.']\",\"['background: the current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. however, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. different estimates of the incubation period of covid-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. in this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. methods: we have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. the renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. findings: the estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. the estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [ci]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% ci: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% ci: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% ci: 19.47, 21.62). compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. interpretation: based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with covid-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods. ###

activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and sars-cov rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity dna polymerase. using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, alovudine and azt (an fda approved hiv/aids drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of sars-cov rdrp. we demonstrate the ability of two hiv reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3\\u2032-fluoro-3\\u2032-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3\\u2032-azido-3\\u2032-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of alovudine and azt), to be incorporated by sars-cov rdrp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. given the 98% amino acid similarity of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 rdrps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the sars-cov-2 polymerase. these results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.']\",\"['the exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection who

human infections and deaths. it is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. however, the structural information of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. herein, we have determined the crystal structure of the n-terminal rna binding domain of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein. although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein n-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. further comparison with mild virus type hcov-oc43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential rna binding pocket alongside the beta-sheet core. complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of sars-cov-2 nucleocapsid protein n-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to sars-cov-2.']\",\"['to assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings or crowded areas and to predict the spread of covid-19 infections in japan, we developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the susceptible-infected-removed (sir) epidemiological model with an additional modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas. the population were divided into three compartments: susceptible, infected, removed. susceptible transitions to infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of infected and the congestion of area. the total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. the time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. this simulation showed that the number of infected and removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. on the other hand, the stagnant growth of infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. in conclusions the infection spread in japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.']\",\"['contact tracing is a central public health response to infectious disease outbreaks, especially in the early stages of an outbreak when specific treatments are limited. importation of novel coronavirus (covid-19) from china and elsewhere into the united kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current uk definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. taking recent estimates for covid-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

facing the covid-19 pandemic. covid-19 is caused by a coronavirus named sars-cov-2. given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. all coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 prf to control the relative expression of their proteins. prior analyses of sars-cov revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mrna pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 prf, that it also harbors a -1 prf attenuation element. altering -1 prf activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. here we present a comparative analysis of the original sars-cov and sars-cov-2 frameshift signals. structural analyses reveal that the core -1 prf signal, composed of the u uua aac slippery site and three-stemmed mrna pseudoknot is highly conserved. in contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 prf and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 prf activity. we suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting sars-cov mediated -1 prf may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.']\",\"['since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) in south korea was confirmed on january 20, 2020, there have been 24 confirmed cases of 2019-ncov. the majority of these

fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. however, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. first, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. in the ongoing covid-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from covid-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. although covid-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.</p>']\",\"['in march 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 originating from wuhan, china, has become pandemic. based on epidemic data from china we constructed and constrained a simple susceptible-infected-infectious-excluded (siie) model. the model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rc, and exclusion rate re. these two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient \\u03b2 describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as e = e exp(\\u03b1,t) with \\u03b1 = ln\\u03b2. the rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rc can be reduced by quarantine, while re can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. in order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rc/re has to be reduced to 1. based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in china on january 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. in contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, italian provinces on february 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rc/re and corresponding decrease of \\u03b2 from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. even higher reduction should take place in france, germany and spain for which \\u03b2 > 1.3

surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. in such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. this scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study was

distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. the model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. findings: the analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. interpretation: isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as

cases that originated in wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during january and february 2020. based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. findings: we estimated that the median daily reproduction number, rt , declined from 2.35 (95% ci: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd january to 1.05 (95% ci: 0.413-2.39) one week after. based on our estimates of rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as wuhan in early january, once

likely declined in wuhan during late january 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. as more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. conclusions the majority of patients with 2019-ncov coronavirus pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.']\",\"['introduction: more than 93,000 cases of coronavirus disease (covid-19) have been reported worldwide. we describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 u.s. patients with covid-19. methods: we collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by cdc during january 20-february 5, 2020 to have covid-19. respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for sars-cov-2 rrt-pcr testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. results: among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to china, and two were contacts of patients in this series. commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. all patients had sars-cov-2 rna detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rrt-pcr ct values often detected in the first week. sars-cov-2 rna was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. sars-cov-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and sars-cov-2 rna was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. conclusions: in 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, sars-cov-2 rna and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged rna detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no

and the number of reported cases has increased day by day. the purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for covid-19 in japan by using the real-time data from 15 january to 29 february 2020. taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well-known seir compartmental model for the prediction. by using a least-square-based method with poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in japan is r 0 = 2 . 6 ( 95 % ci, 2 . 4 - 2 . 8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer. in addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.']\",\"['background: community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the covid-19 epidemic in hong kong. method: a cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed covid-19 cases were first reported. councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve covid-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. result: analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). most respondents were worried about covid-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). the anxiety level, measured by the hospital anxiety and depression scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). the most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to china were frequently adopted (>77%) and considered effective (>90%). the adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aor]:1.27), living in the new territories (aor:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of covid-19 (aor:1.84) and being more anxious (aor:1.07). discussion: risk perception towards covid-19 in the community was high. most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. this study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current covid-19 epidemic. the timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses. ###

2020. design: travel network-based modelling study. setting and participants: general population travelling from wuhan and other high-risk cities in china. main outcome measures: based on de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports, we defined the relative importation risk and internal and international destinations of 2019-ncov from wuhan and other high-risk cities in china. results: the cordon sanitaire of wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before lunar new year (lny), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in china, and a high proportion of cases likely travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak. should secondary outbreaks occur in 17 high-risk secondary cities, they could contribute to seeding the virus in other highly connected cities within and beyond china after the lny holiday. we estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% ui: 478 - 1349) had 2019-ncov infection, travelled from wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland china during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of wuhan. the majority of these cities were in asia, but major hubs in europe, the us and australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases seen. because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in china and destinations across the globe for the following three months of february to april, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. conclusion: further spread of 2019-ncov within china and international exportation is likely to occur. all countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-ncov infection. ###

built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (seir) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland china. we used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in wuhan to parameterise the transmission before npis were implemented. to quantify the relative effect of various npis, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across china. the model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. results: we estimated that there were a total of 114,325 covid-19 cases (interquartile range [iqr] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland china as of february 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, r2=0.86) with reported incidence. without npis, the number of covid-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (iqr: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. the early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated npis would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. if npis could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in china, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. however, if npis were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across china, respectively. results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in china to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on february 17, 2020. conclusion: the npis deployed in china appear to be effectively containing the covid-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. moreover, deploying the npis early is also important to prevent further spread. early and integrated npi strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the world. ### competing interest statement the

report the identification of 2019-ncov related coronaviruses in pangolins (manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern china. metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated covs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-ncov related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-ncov in the receptor-binding domain. the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin

search data are routinely used to monitor the prevalence of infectious diseases, such as influenza. previous work has focused on developing supervised models, where ground truth data, in the form of historical syndromic surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models. however, no sufficient data -- in terms of accuracy and time span -- exist to apply such approaches for monitoring the emerging covid-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2). therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised solutions should be sought. recent outcomes have shown that it is possible to transfer an online search based model for influenza-like illness from a source to a target country without using ground truth data for the target location. the

england in the united kingdom (uk), and (ii) weighting them based on their reported ratio of occurrence in people infected by covid-19. finally, understanding that online searches may be also driven by concern rather than infections, we devise a preliminary approach that aims to minimise this part of the signal by incorporating a news media signal in association with confirmed covid-19 cases.

hubei province of china since december 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries around the world. to better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-ncov spike receptor-binding domain (rbd) bound with the cell receptor ace2 at 2.45 angstrom resolution. the overall ace2-binding mode of the 2019-ncov rbd is nearly identical to that of the sars-cov rbd, which also utilizes ace2 as the cell receptor. structural analysis identified residues in 2019-ncov rbd critical for ace2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the sars-cov rbd. such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-ncov and sars-cov rbd for improved binding to ace2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. the epitopes of two sars-cov antibodies targeting the rbd are also analyzed with the 2019-ncov rbd, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.']\",\"['background: with its epicenter in wuhan, china, the covid-19 outbreak

domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed covid-19 cases and determined the growth curves of covid-19 cases within china before and after lockdown as well as after changes in covid-19 diagnostic criteria. results: our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% confidence interval, ci): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% ci: 3.5-4.3), after imposing lockdown. a further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% ci: 15.1-26.3), respectively. moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and covid-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r=0.98, p<0.05 vs. after lockdown: r=0.91, p=ns). conclusions: a significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to chinese lockdown measures. a more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of covid-19.']\",\"['background a novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), was identified in china in december 2019. there is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features,

measurements patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. results there were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of covid-19. the median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% ci, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (ci, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. these estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. limitation publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. conclusion this work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for covid-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to sars. our results support current proposals for the length of quarantine or active monitoring of persons potentially exposed to sars-cov-2, although longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases. primary funding source u.s. centers for disease

intervention to control the covid-19 epidemic has led to interest in whether other countries can replicate it as well as concerns about a resurgence of the epidemic if or when china relaxes the interventions. in this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. we see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. for minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. in populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. we do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. we believe that is a policy question. if an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by the

severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. since sars- cov was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage b betacoronaviruses, such as sars-cov and the recent 2019-ncov, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. we show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage b viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage b viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. we also demonstrate how different lineage b viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ace2 is the receptor

detect sars-cov-2 at low copy numbers. the assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. in addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for

*preprint - not peer-reviewed* since the 2019-ncov (covid-19) outbreaks in wuhan, china, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. the traffic blockage and quarantine can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections. evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. we apply our flow-seir model to estimate the number of infections as well as the evaluate the policy of traffic blockage and quarantine, based on the data of confirmed case and the migration in china. we define two factors related to traffic blockage and quarantine to estimate the efficacy of these two intervation measures. in our study, since the public are urged to stay at home and self-protective, the self-protection at home is also accounted as a part of quarantine. in the simulated results, the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, when the quarantine factor \\u03b5 is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak number of infections will decrease by 89.68%. and the traffic blockage is also effective, however, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of the infections. for hubei province, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 24.26% - 25.33%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%. for the other provinces outside hubei, if the quarantine is one week of earlier, the peak number will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%. if there is one day in advance for urban blockage, about 3,600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. if there is one day of delay, about 1,800 people will finally be at risk. in general, the effect of quarantine is even stronger than the traffic blockage control. the fact should not be ignored that there are still a large number of population who are exposed to the sars-cov-2 but not yet symptomatic. those exposed population is not easy to be found and infect others who are closely contacting with. so the traffic blockage and quarantine should be

2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) emerged in wuhan, china in december 2019 and has been spreading rapidly in china. decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. methods we conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (r0) of covid-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the china national health commission for the period 10th january to 8th february. we analyzed the data for the period before the closure of wuhan city (10th january to 23rd january) and the post-closure period (23rd january to 8th february) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of wuhan city on spread of covid-19. findings before the closure of wuhan city the basic reproduction number of covid-19 was 4.38 (95% ci: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% ci: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of wuhan city. over the entire epidemic period covid-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% ci: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. interpretation covid-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. the closure of wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus. ### competing interest statement the authors have

(ace2) is now confirmed as the receptor of sars-cov-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. in present study, we collected the online available single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ace2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. our results revealed that ace2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. meanwhile, ace2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human

every 7.4 days. with a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% ci, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% ci, 1.4 to 3.9). conclusions on the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of december 2019. considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

methods: we described the intensive care unit (icu) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed covid-19 patients in two chinese cities (wuhan and guangzhou) from january 10 to february 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of sars-cov-2 community spread. we estimated the peak icu bed needs in us cities if a wuhan-like outbreak occurs. results: in wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of sars-cov-2. between january 10 and february 29, covid-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 icu patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. during the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. in guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. between january 24 and february 29, covid-19 accounted for an average of 9 icu patients and 20 inpatients on each day. during the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. if a wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a us city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. conclusion: even after the lockdown of wuhan on january 23, the number of seriously ill covid-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and icu capacities for at least a month. plans are urgently needed

protein ion channel activity (eic) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. in this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (ibv) as a model to study eic. two recombinant ibvs (ribvs) harboring eic-inactivating mutations - rt16a and ra26f - were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (tmd). two ribvs harboring these putative eic-reverting mutations - rt16a/a26v and ra26f/f14n - were recovered. compared with the parental ribv-p65 control, all four eic mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular rna synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. our results showed that the ibv eic contributed to the induction of er stress response, as up-regulation of er stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the eic-defective mutants. eic-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative eic revertants. eic mutations were also implicated in regulating ibv-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. taken together, this study highlights the importance of cov eic in modulating virion release and various aspects of cov - host interaction.']\",\"['based on the seir model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a general-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in chinese cities is built. the chinese public transportation system between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). at each city, an open-system seir model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the overlying transportation network. the model accounts for (1) different transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. the model could be used to simulate the city-level spread in china (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from any chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions are implemented. flowmaps are input into the system to trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. the model is used to simulate the 2019 coronavirus epidemic in wuhan; it shows that the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.']\",\"['to investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of sars-cov-2 in china, a total of 70 genomes of

re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative sars-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. we performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. based on bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time

we also identified a unique peptide (prra) insertion in the human sars-cov-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the rrar motif. therefore, we concluded that the human sars-cov-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of covid-19, did not come directly from pangolins. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.']\",\"['background china is running a national level antivirus campaign

significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. thus, we suspect that ace2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-ncov infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more

group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-covid-19 group. demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung ct findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. findings the prevalence of covid-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). compared with the non-covid-19 group, more patients with covid-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, p<0.001). the covid-19 group had lower wbc [5.19\\u00d710^9/l (\\u00b11.47) versus 7.21\\u00d710^9/l (\\u00b12.94), p<0.001] and neutrophil

(covid-19) by who, has caused more than 2, 000 deaths worldwide since its emergency in wuhan city, hubei province, china, in december, 2019. the symptoms of covid-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) from 3 severe and 3 mild covid-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell rna sequence (scrna-seq) combined with tcr-seq. our data shows that monocyte-derived fcn1+ macrophages, whereas notfabp4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in balf from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ards. these cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal cd8+ t cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of covid-19. this study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in covid-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in covid-19. ###

detection efficiency and accuracy. methods: paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and rna was extracted and tested for 2019-ncov (equated with sars-cov-2) by qrt-pcr assay. results: the positive rates of 2019-ncov from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qrt-pcr assay (p=0.001). conclusions: the detection rates of 2019-ncov from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. we suggest that

public health threat. the covid-19 emerged in december 2019 in wuhan, china and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. the variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. as most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. method: using the cases reported from the national health commission of china and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from january 20, 2020 to feb 13, 2020 in wuhan, hubei province and other 28 provinces in china. we quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (r\\\\\\\\_t) of covid-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. findings: we estimated that r\\\\\\\\_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in hubei and other provinces. the ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from january 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on january 23, 2020. the mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. we have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around february 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in wuhan. interpretation: public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of covid-19 in wuhan and other provinces. model prediction results suggested that covid- 19 will be contained around the end of february 2020 in china. keywords: coronavirus, covid-19, transmissibility, dynamic reproduction number r, statistical modelling, pneumonia outbreak ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of sars-cov-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. overall, potential rt-pcr vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate

anxiety among medical staff from 10th february 2020 to 20th february 2020 in china using the zung self-rating anxiety scale (sas) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (\\u226449), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (\\u226570). we used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. we also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. results: of 512 medical staff from china, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. the prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (\\u03b2value=2.33, ci: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). similar things were observed in medical staff from hubei province, compared with those from other parts of china (\\u03b2value=3.67, ci: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). the most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (\\u03b2value=4.44, ci: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). conclusion: our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the covid-19 epidemic. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this research received no specific grant

novel coronavirus disease (covid-19) and their correlation with the disease severity remain unclear. method: peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed covid-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. findings: of the 40 covid-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of t cells, especially cd8 + t cells, as well as increases in il-6, il-10, il-2 and ifn-\\u03b3 levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. t cell counts and cytokine levels in severe covid-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. moreover, the neutrophil-to-cd8+ t cell ratio (n8r) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe covid-19. conclusion: the degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe covid-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. n8r may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe covid-19 cases. ### competing interest statement the authors have

of serological assay for sars-cov-2. methods a newly-developed elisa assay for igm and igg antibodies against n protein of sars-cov-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected sars-cov-2 infection from february 6 to february 14, 2020. sars-cov-2 rna was detected by real time rt-pcr on pharyngeal swab specimens. findings of the 238 patients, 194

between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. after the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. after 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. on the contrary, the positive rates of viral rna kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. in addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. interpretation the suspected patients were most likely infected by sars-cov-2. before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. the combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. after that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. keywords. sars-cov-2; diagnosis;

march 2020, we forecast the disease spread and assess the effectiveness of containment strategies by using an estalished network-driven epidemic dynamic model. our model is initialized using the daily

corresponding to a daily active count of \\u2248 7% of the us population, if no containment plans are implemented. epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of washington and new york by may 21 and 25, respectively. with a modest 25% reduction in covid-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. in addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations. ###

this study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of covid-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (cvms) with in-hospital outcomes of covid-19 cases. methods: retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed covid-19 were collected at the central hospital of wuhan in wuhan, china, from january 15 to january 24, 2020. epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. final date of follow-up was march 3, 2020. a comparative study was applied between cases with cvms and those without cvms. results: of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. the population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. the three most frequent symptoms of covid-19 cases analyzed were fever

of this newly emerging virus to other parts of the world.']\",\"['objectives: we aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of ncp across china, and compared them with sars. methods: data on ncp cases by february 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) cases in guangdong province, beijing and hongkong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. we estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (r0) and time-varying reproduction number (rt) of ncp and sars. measurements and main results: as of february 7, 2020, 34,598 ncp cases were identified in china, and daily confirmed cases decreased after february 4. the doubling time of ncp nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of sars in guangdong (14.3 days), hong kong (5.7 days) and beijing (12.4 days). the r0 of ncp cases nationwide and in wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than r0 of sars in guangdong(r0=2.3), hongkong (r0=2.3), and beijing (r0=2.6). the rt for ncp continuously decreased especially after january 16 nationwide and in wuhan. the r0 for secondary ncp cases in guangdong was 0.6, and the rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. conclusions: ncp may have a higher transmissibility than sars, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. however, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.']\",\"['abstract. background: the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in wuhan city, china spreads rapidly since december, 2019. most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. there is currently no specific medication. the purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe covid-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. methods clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type covid-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. the relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. results a total of 69 severe type covid-19 patients were included. on admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. the most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). diarrhea is less common. the most common comorbidity is hypertension. upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (ct) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), c-reactive protein (crp), ferritin and d-dimer was found in most cases. two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. however, baseline interleukin-6 (il-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to ct findings. baseline il-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of crp, ldh, ferritin and d-dimer. the increase of baseline il-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of covid-19. among the 30 severe type patients whose il-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in il-6 and improved ct assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. whereas the il-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. it is suggested that il-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe covid-19 patients. conclusions on admission, the baseline level of il-6, crp, ldh and ferritin was closely related to the severity of covid-19, and the elevated il-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. the decrease of il-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of il-6 indicated disease exacerbation. collectively, the dynamic change of il-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe covid-19. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial this is a retrospective observational study for 2019 novel

on-going gene flow. however, the genetic underpinnings, as well as the scale and magnitude at which this differentiation occurs in marine habitats are not well understood. we investigated the patterns and degree of genomic heterogeneity in threespine sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus) by assessing genetic variability in 20 nongenic and 20 genic (associated with genes important for freshwater adaptation) microsatellite loci in samples collected from 38 locations spanning the entire baltic sea coast to the north sea boundary. population divergence (f(st) \\u2248 0.026) and structuring (five genetic clusters) was significantly more pronounced in the genic as compared to nongenic markers (f(st) \\u2248 0.008; no genetic clusters). patterns of divergence in the genic markers--45% of which were identified as outliers--correlated with local differences in salinity. yet, a strong positive correlation between divergence in genic and nongenic markers, and their association with environmental factors suggests that adaptive divergence is reducing gene flow across the genome. apart from providing a clear demonstration of heterogeneous genomic patterns of differentiation in a marine species, the results are indicative of adaptive population structuring across the relatively young baltic sea in spite of ample opportunities for gene flow.']\",\"['the human coronavirus hcov-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. we screened an fda approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (dip) suppressed hcov-19 replication at an ec50 of 100 nm in vitro. it also elicited potent type i interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. in analysis of twelve hcov-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that dip supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased d-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. two weeks after initiation of dip treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. one critically ill patient with extremely high levels of d-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving dip passed away. all other patients were in clinical remission. in summary, hcov-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from dip adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. larger scale clinical trials of dip are needed to validate these therapeutic effects. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial chictr2000030055 ### funding statement national key r&d program of china

quarantine-susceptible-exposed-infectious-resistant (qseir) model which considers the unprecedented strict quarantine measures in almost the whole of china to resist the epidemic. we estimated model

predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the qseir model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland china. the main results are as follows. if the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range february 7 to february 19, 2020. during march18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. the end date would be in the period from august 20 to september 1, 2020. with 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. the sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). the long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland china showed that the qseir model is stable and can be empirically validated. it is suggested that the qseir model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. in mainland china, the quarantine measures', \\\"can't\\\", 'be relaxed

hospitalization. ebola virus disease (evd), severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars), and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission. this investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (mrr) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (dsoh) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of evd, sars, and mers, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks. we found that epidemic week and viral serial interval were correlated with the speed with which populations developed and maintained health behaviors in each outbreak.']\",\"['sars-cov-2, a novel coronavirus (cov), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. while genetically distinct from the original sars-cov, both group 2b coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. importantly, initial guidance has used insights from sars-cov infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. in this report, we evaluate sars-cov-2 relative to the original sars-cov. our results indicate that while sars-cov-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to sars-cov in vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to type i interferon pretreatment. we subsequently examined homology between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. the absence of open reading frame (orf) 3b and significant changes to orf6 suggest the two key ifn antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in sars-cov-2. together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the ifn response between sars-cov and sars-cov-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.']\",\"['one of the reasons for the fast spread of sars-cov-2 is the lack of accuracy in detection tools in the clinical field. molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time rt-pcr and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. for this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. in addition, sars-cov-2 is remarkably similar to other coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. to tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. the proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. experiments on data from the novel coronavirus resource (2019ncovr) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify sars-cov-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as mers-cov, hcov-nl63, hcov-oc43, hcov-229e, hcov-hku1, and sars-cov regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). from a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying sars-cov-2 with an auc of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. then, using the same basis, we classify sars-cov-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene orf1ab from the ncbi with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. these preliminary results seem encouraging enough to

of sars-cov-2 outbreak in shanghai. design: a retrospective descriptive study setting: china participants: epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to shanghai public health center with confirmed covid-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. main outcome measure: prevention and control measures taken by shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. weibull distribution, chi-square test,', \\\"fisher's\\\", 'exact test, t test or mann-whitney u test were used in statistical analysis. results: covid-19 transmission rate within shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where >50% of cases were local. the incubation period was 6.4 (95% ci 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% ci, 5.1 to 5.9). median time for covid-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (iqr: 4.8-11.0 days). by february 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. conclusion: strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. most covid-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction. keyword: covid-19,

we aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected covid-19, and develop a mortality risk index for covid-19 patients. methods: in this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected covid-19 patients hospitalized in a covid-19-designated hospital from january 21 to february 5, 2020. demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. results: of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [iqr], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were sars-cov-2 positive. the clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative sars-cov-2 patients. during a median follow-up of 8.4 days (iqr, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% ci, 5.9% to 11.5%). a simple mortality risk index (called acp index), composed of age and c-reactive protein, was developed. by applying the acp index, patients were categorized into three grades. the 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age \\u2265 60 years and crp \\u2265 34 mg/l) was 33.2% (95% ci, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age \\u2265 60 years and crp < 34 mg/l; age < 60 years and crp \\u2265 34 mg/l; 5.6% [95% ci, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age < 60 years and crp < 34 mg/l, 0%) (p <0.001), respectively. conclusion: the acp index can predict covid-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a covid-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

microbial agent were reported in wuhan, china. a novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). as of jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-ncov infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. methods: we did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the huanan seafood market in wuhan. complete and partial 2019-ncov genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. viral contigs were connected using sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cdna ends. phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-ncov genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. findings: the ten genome sequences of 2019-ncov obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99\\u00b798% sequence identity. notably, 2019-ncov was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-like coronaviruses, bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21, collected in 2018 in zhoushan, eastern china, but were more distant from sars-cov (about 79%) and mers-cov (about 50%). phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-ncov fell within the subgenus sarbecovirus of the genus betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-sl-covzc45 and bat-sl-covzxc21, and was genetically distinct from sars-cov. notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-ncov had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of sars-cov, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. interpretation: 2019-ncov is sufficiently divergent from sars-cov to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-ncov might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. the future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation. funding: national

tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell rna sequencing, respectively. while tmprss2 is expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ace2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to rho gtpase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for sars-cov-2 infection. our data provide a rich resource for future investigations of

structures from traditional chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in sars-cov and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target rdrp of sars-cov-2, sars-cov and mers-cov. we found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of rdrp in sars-cov-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), sars-cov (-8.03 kcal/mol) and mers-cov (-8.26

disease remain to be clarified. this study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (r0) of covid-19. methods between late february and early march of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of covid-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside china and from 1790 publications identified in pubmed and cnki. to be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. as relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (< 0.3 day). depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. findings in total, 1155 cases from china, japan, singapore, south korea, vietnam, germany and malaysia were included for the final analysis. the mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. r0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. for 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. in 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. in 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. asymptomatic transmission was also observed. interpretation this study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of covid-19. the findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. the estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. this together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures. ###

screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on february 4, were effective in the epidemic control. no new covid-19 case had been diagnosed since february 13. during the epidemic, 7 hd patients died, including 6 with covid-19 and 1 without covid-19. the presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the hd patients infected with covid-19 decreased, and the ct images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. the symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to icu. the frequency of lymphocytes in pbmcs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in hd patients contracted covid-19 or not, non-hd covid-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. the results showed that lymphocytes of t cell, th cells, killer t cells, as well as nk cells in pbmcs of hd patients decreased significantly than other groups. hd patients with covid-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other covid-19 patients. our study indicates that hd patients are the highly susceptible population and hd centers are high risk area in the outbreak of covid-19 epidemic. measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. hd patients with covid-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the

methodologically, we introduced tpl (taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (untb) [specifically harris et al. (2015) hdp-msn model (hierarchical dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. first, tpl analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (tpl-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. another tpl parameter (m0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (covid-19/sars), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). m0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if m0 coincides or below the level of allee effects. it was found that covid-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than sars, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than sars since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. second, metacommunity untb neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. specifically, two parameters {\\\\\\\\theta} and m, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions.']\",\"['we have applied a computational strategy, based

distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases with time during the early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate. although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in mainland china, the scaling law t^\\u03bc is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents \\u03bc = 2.1 \\u00b1 0.3. the universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. we show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. to this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. for a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. the model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. these insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced covid-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

january 2020 to 19 february 2020. main outcome measures: clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (cns) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (pns) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. results: of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 \\u00b1 15.0 years vs 48.9 \\u00b1 14.7 years), had more underlying

2019-ncov) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop this new epidemic. the previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) in 2003, and the middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus (mers-cov) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. the most promising compound is remdesivir (gs-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating ebola virus infections. remdesivir inhibited the replication of sars-cov and mers-cov in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. in addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (lpv/rtv-infb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with sars-cov. lpv/rtv-infb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with mers-cov. remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of lpv/rtv-infb against mers-cov in a transgenic humanized mice model. the relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, sars-cov, mers-cov, and sars-cov-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. it remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. this minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that showed potential in fighting sars-cov-2 infections.</p>']\",\"['worldwide severe acute respiratory

complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded taiwan, the united states, and japan were introduced independently. we identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (ctc, tcc, and tct). viruses found outside china did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. these results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border

the effective concentration of ciclesonide to block sars-cov-2 (the cause of covid-19) replication (ec90) was 6.3 \\u03bcm. after the eleventh consecutive mers-cov passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (a25v) in nonstructural protein (nsp) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. a recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. these observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate

protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of sars-cov-2. compared with sars-cov, we found a sprr insertion in the s1/s2 protease cleavage sites of sars-cov-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ace2 and tmprsss are highly coexpressed in at2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of sars-cov-2 and indicate its potential

which largely depends on virus-binding host cell receptors and host cell proteases-cleaving virus spike protein. in order to identify the virus transmission of 2019-ncov, the protease-induced spike protein cleavage ability between 2019-ncov and sars-cov were compared. by protein sequence aligment and structure comparison, we found the key sequence of 675-qtqtnsprrarsvas-679 mediating 2019-ncov spike protein cleavage. its furin score (0.688) was higher than that of the corresponding sequence in sars-cov (0.139). in addition, the fragment of 680-sprr-683 added two arginine hydrolysis sites (r682 and r683) on the surface and formed a loop for protease recognition. the molecular docking was based on the transmembrane serine protease (tmprss), the main proteases in coronavirus cleavage. furthermore, as the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme ii (ace2) and cell proteases tmprsss are located in the same cell, the single-cell transcriptomes of normal human lung and gastroenteric

transmission potential of emerging disease. the present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-ncov in wuhan city, china, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics. methods: we employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. for estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed ncov cases and deaths in wuhan city and epidemiological data of japanese evacuees from wuhan city on board government-chartered flights were used. results: we found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (r) in wuhan city, china in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%cri: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after january 23rd in 2020 has declined r to 3.24 (95%cri: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%cri: 759475-1296258) in wuhan city, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%cri: 7.6-13.0%). we also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (ifr) and time-delay adjusted ifr is estimated to be 0.07% (95% cri: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%cri: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude cfr at 4.06% conclusions: we have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-ncov in wuhan, china, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. the power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement km

hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including s-associated coronavirus strain hsr1. here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the sars-cov-2 spike s1 protein receptor binding domain (sars-cov-2 s1 rbd) and heparin. the data demonstrate an interaction between the

more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths worldwide. during the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (covid) are rising worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and control the virus with limited resource. in this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of covid to predict and control the outbreak. the basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. a detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. we calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from five provinces of china namely, hubei, guangdong, henan, zhejiang and hunan. our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ($r_0>1$, $r_c>1$) is already present in all the five provinces. short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new covid cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. however, long term predictions for hubei reveals that the symptomatic covid cases will show oscillatory behaviour. further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. numerical results show that the modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the covid cases in hubei. thus, covid is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. health care officials should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in the affected areas.']\",\"['a novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) first detected in wuhan, china, has spread rapidly since december 2019, causing over 45,000 pcr confirmed infections and more than 1,000 fatalities (as of feb 12, 2020). imported cases and small transmission clusters have been reported globally. early data suggest the virus transmits readily and a pandemic cannot be ruled out. data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229e, hku1, nl63, oc43). we use these data to explore the effect of seasonal variation in transmissibility on a potential sars-cov-2 pandemic. a model allowing for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters of sars-cov-2 spread shows how a pandemic could unfold in 2020-2022. simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a peak in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere in winter 2020/2021. a smaller range of parameters suggests a peak in the first half of 2020 or two peaks of similar magnitude. variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. while the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. seasonal forcing on sars-cov-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. the likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

covid-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [icus] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify covid-19 patients. containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and

assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. we therefore used a bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of singapore. we estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% hpdi 22% - 64%) of singapore\\u2032s capacity. equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as singapore. using the second component of the global health security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% hpdi 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% hpdi 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% hpdi 0% - 42%). using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. we conclude that estimates of case counts in wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak. ### competing interest statement marc lipsitch has received consulting fees from merck. all other authors declare no competing interests. ### funding

the virus leading to collatoral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. this is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. the most sought after estimate is the projected number of people who may be contagious, but still be within the incubation period thus remaining asymptomatic and undetected. this parameter is useful for estimating the extent of outbreak among a population over time and what to expect. it is thus important for common sense decision making by governments, organizations, and even individuals to contain, prepare, prevent, react, and safeguard. a monte carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and a variable, called testing efficiency as variables. the coronavirus outbreak in usa will be used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach.

used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. only china cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between january 23 and march 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of mainland china. several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. the median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted r square above 0.75 were selected. the rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively

host. protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. in the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike receptor binding domain (rbd) from different coronavirus isolates with host ace2 protein. we used homology-based protein-protein docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein rbd might be acquired by sars-cov-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. we also highlighted the relevance of q493 and p499 amino acid residues of sars-cov-2 rbd for binding to hace2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ace2, on the complex formation with sars-cov-2 rbd. we found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral rbd of sars-cov-2.']\",\"['the outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus

diverse species. given the importance of the spike glycoprotein (s) protein in viral entry and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-em structure of the sads-cov s in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 angstrom. our studies reveal that sads-cov s structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the ntd and ctd from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. the comparison of ntd and ctd with that of the other four genera gives the suggestion of the evolutionary procedure of the sads-cov s. moreover, sads-cov s has several characteristic structural features, i.e., more compact architecture of s trimer, masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate to viral immune evasion. these data provide new insights

of china. special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (isse). findings: the basic reproductive number (r0) was calculated for the period between 18 january 2020 and 16 february 2020: r0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the wuhan area). at the same time, wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 february 2020. the number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the wuhan area) peaked around february 3. the results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in wuhan occurred on february 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on february 3. concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time covid-19 inpatients in wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on february 14 before it decreases. the model further shows that the covid-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of april 2020, both in wuhan and the other parts of china. the number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on march 27 in wuhan and march 19 in the entire country. the five cities with top risk index in china with the exclusion of wuhan are: huanggang, xiaogan, jingzhou, chongqing, and xiangyang city. interpretations: although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. as the return-to-work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the covid-19 in

reproductive number r o, the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. the modeling approaches and resulting estimates of r o vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. aim we aimed to develop a framework for comparing and combining different estimates of r o across a wide range of models. methods we reviewed 7 model-based analyses of the 2019-ncov outbreak that were published online between january 23--26, 2020. we decompose their r o estimates into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r , the mean generation interval, g bar, and the generation-interval dispersion \\u03ba. we use a bayesian multilevel model to construct pooled estimates and measure uncertainties associated with these quantities. results we find that most early estimates of r o rely on strong assumptions, especially about the generation-interval dispersion. estimates that rely on narrow generation-interval distributions are overly sensitive to estimates of the exponential growth rate. conclusion our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of r o, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate r o at the outset of an epidemic. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement bmb

china and quickly spreads to other counties. currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for covid-19. the neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. in this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to sars-cov-2 sipke (s) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral s protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. the sequence analysis of s protein showed two major differences in the rbd region of the sars-cov-2 s protein compared to sars-cov and sars-cov related bat viruses (btsars-cov). the insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ace2 receptor. epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that sars-cov neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas mers-cov neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the \\u03b2-sheet structure in mers-cov s protein and deleted in sars-cov-2 s protein. to identify effective neutralizing antibodies for sars-cov-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with sars-cov-2 s protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. the result showed that cr3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with sars-cov-2 s protein than sars-cov s protein. we also found that f26g19 and d12 mouse antibodies could bind to sars-cov s protein with high affinity. our findings provide crucial

need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like sars and mers, frequently encompasses the receptor binding domain (rbd) in the spike gene. we find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-ncov involving the rbd. compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-ncov accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the rbd and likewise in a region of polyprotein orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the sars 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427n and 436y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. both 427n and 436y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ace2 receptor. in sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-ncov virus whereby the 2019-ncov ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of sars by incorporation of a sars-like rbd through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.']\",\"['individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). to estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control covid-19, we fit a stochastic branching model,

only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. however, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of covid-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. in such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. to the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of covid-19. our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts. ### competing

bioinformatics. a solution would be significant as protein structure in-formation could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. this paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3d images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-em). a fully automated computationally efficient pro-tein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-em as the tech-nology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. we present a deep learning approach, deeptracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. in order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. results: we trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-em density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. we found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average rmsd value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. furthermore, we detected secondary struc-ture information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. we also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3d cryo-em density map, considering 20 dif-ferent types in total. finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of deeptracer is significantly im-proved compared to other methods. it predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.']\",\"['zoonotic coronaviruses (covs) are significant threats to global health, as exemplified by the recent emergence of

accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. accordingly, we found that ly6e directly protects primary b cells and dendritic cells from murine cov infection. our results demonstrate that ly6e is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls cov infection and pathogenesis. these findings advance our understanding of

december 2019, a novel strain of sars-cov-2 emerged in wuhan, china. since then, the city of wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. methods: we quantified the

transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. findings: changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). there are benefits to sustaining these measures until april in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. however, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. interpretation: restrictions on activities in wuhan, if maintained until april, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. however, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of r0 and the

approach that uses sir model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. the treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. we apply our model to indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after

was conducted to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine (mev) against sars-cov-2. seven antigenic proteins were taken as a target and epitopes (b cell, ifn- \\u03b3 and t cell) were predicted. highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. selected t cell epitopes indicated significant interactions with the hla-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. finally, 505 amino acids long mev was designed by connecting sixteen mhc class i and twelve mhc class ii epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the vaccine. the allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and structural details of mev were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. mev construct was non-allergenic and antigenic. molecular docking demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of mev with tlr3 and tlr8. codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured increased

total of 267 patients with covid-19 confirmed by real-time rt-pcr in chongqing from jan 19 to feb 16, 2020 were recruited. epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. clinical outcomes were followed up until feb 16, 2020. results\\uff1a267 laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in chongqing provincial municipality from january 19 to february 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. the median age of patients was 48.0 years (iqr, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [iqr, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [iqr, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from hubei. on admission, the most common symptoms of covid-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for covid-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118

(5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). traditional chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). conclusion:our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of covid-19 in chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. the 28-day mortality of covid-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of hubei province and mainland china including hubei province. however, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ards is considerably as high as 44.4%. therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe covid-19 cases, especially those combined with ards, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this

in wuhan, hubei, china, has been declared a global public health emergency. angiotensin i converting enzyme 2 (ace2), is the host receptor by 2019-ncov to infect human cells. although ace2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-ncov may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ace2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. to identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported rna virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ace2 was mainly expressed in lung at2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ecs, rectum ecs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ace2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including anpep, dpp4 and enpep. among them, anpep and dpp4 are the known receptors for human covs, suggesting enpep as another potential receptor for human covs. we also conducted \\\"cellphonedb\\\" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between cov-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. we found that macrophages frequently communicate with the covs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.']\",\"['objective to evaluate sleep disturbances of chinese frontline medical workers (fmw) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, and make a

calculate its case fatality rate (cfr). methods: the method was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases t days before, where t was an average time period from case confirmation to death. it was found that supposing a t, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true t, calculated cfrs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true cfr

zoonotically and cause severe respiratory disease syndromes. cov infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. several cov strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an s1a that engages host sialic acids and an s1b that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. as this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic cov infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine jhm-cov and human middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. these results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. however, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. this virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive s1a mutations. overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of cov infections.</p>']\",\"['background: cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) emigrated from wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. this report focused on the outside-wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. methods: contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in hunan province (geographically adjacent to wuhan) from jan 22, 2020 to feb 12, 2020. demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. patients were confirmed by pcr test. results: of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. family clusters were the major body of patients. transmission along the chain of 3 &ldquo:generations\\u201d was observed. mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. the median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. just 9 of 16 severe patients required icu care. until feb 12, 2020, 40 (38.46%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. for the antiviral treatment, 80 (76.92%) patients received traditional chinese medicine therapy. conclusions: family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers. asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of covid-19. the incubation period of 8 patients exceeded 14 days. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ###

(http://index.baidu.com) and the website of chinese center for disease control and prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (sv) of keywords for symptoms associated with covid-19 from january 1 to february 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in china and the epidemic data. data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. data of hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. the differences and characteristics of the sv of covid-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the sv of covid-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. results: compared the data from january 1 to february 20, 2020, with the sv for the same period of previous three years,', \\\"hubei's\\\", 'sv for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. the total sv of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (p<0.001). the sv of covid-19 in hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (r(confirmed) = 0.723, r(suspected) = 0.863, all p < 0.001). the results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. conclusions: the total sv of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the sv of diarrhea also increased significantly. it warns us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with covid-19. there is a relationship between internet retrieval behavior and the number of new confirmed or suspected cases. big data has a certain role in the early warning of infectious diseases. \\u76ee\\u7684\\uff1a

with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of seio (mh) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in wuhan. methods a real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of wuhan in status susceptible (s), exposed (e), infected with symptoms (i), with medical care (m), and out of the system (o) daily. model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from jan. 27th, 2020 to feb. 2nd, 2020. using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. finding according to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on nov. 29th, 2019. there had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number r\\\\\\\\_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas r\\\\\\\\_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. the peak point is feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is jun. 17th, 2020. in total, 77,453 people will be infected. if lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. a delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. interpretation our model forecasted that the peak time in wuhan was feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in wuhan is now under control. the outbreak of sars-cov-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. multiple countries including south korea, japan, iran, italy, and the united states are suffering from sars-cov-2. our study, which simulated the epidemic in wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against sars-cov-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

of various socioeconomic factors in mediating the local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) in china. we implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. our 2sls estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late january significantly reduced the transmission rate of covid-19. by early february, the virus spread had been contained. while many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late january played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. we also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. the results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of

wuhan, china. the first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-december 2019. clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. as of 28 january 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with > 100 known deaths. as with the sars-cov, infections in children appear to be rare. travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland china including germany, france, thailand, japan, south korea, vietnam, canada, and the united states, as well as hong kong and taiwan. domestically in china, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. while zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. there are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? what is the animal reservoir? is there an intermediate animal reservoir? do the vaccines generated to the sars-cov or mers-cov or their proteins offer protection against 2019-ncov? we offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. we also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-ncov spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development. diagnostic pcr protocols can be found at

to various countries across the globe triggering a heightened containment effort. this human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense rna genome. understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. the present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-ncov genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. this ncov genotype might have been evolved from a bat-cov by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. structural proteins spike (s), and membrane (m) had extensive mutational changes, whereas envelope (e) and nucleocapsid (n) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-ncov during evolution. interestingly, 2019-ncov spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide (5\\u2019-aat ggt gtt gaa ggt ttt aat tgt tac ttt cct tta caa tca-3\\u2019) sequence

is being compared to the infamous sars coronavirus outbreak. between november 2002 and july 2003, sars resulted in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. mainland china alone suffered 349 deaths and 5327 confirmed cases. though 2019-ncov has a death rate of 2.2% as of 3 february, the 174895 confirmed cases in a few weeks (december 8, 2019 to february 3, 2020) are alarming. cases are likely under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. such outbreaks demand rapid elucidation and analysis of the virus genomic sequence for timely treatment plans. we classify the 2019-ncov using mldsp and mldsp-gui, alignment-free methods that use machine learning (ml) and digital signal processing (dsp) for genome analyses. genomic sequences were mapped into their respective genomic signals (discrete numeric series) using a two-dimensional numerical representation (chaos game representation). the magnitude spectra were computed by applying discrete fourier transform on the genomic signals. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to calculate a pairwise distance matrix. the feature vectors were constructed from the distance matrix and used as an input to the supervised machine learning algorithms. 10-fold cross-validation was applied to compute the average classification accuracy scores. the trained classifier models were used to predict the labels of 29 2019-ncov sequences. the classification strategy used over 5000 genomes and tested associations at taxonomic levels of realm to species. from our machine learning-based alignment-free analyses using mldsp-gui, we corroborate the current hypothesis of a bat origin and classify 2019-ncov as sarbecovirus, within betacoronavirus.']\",\"['we are proposing to use machine

is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. there is good evidence that ace2 is a receptor for 2019-ncov, and studies also suggested that high expression of ace2 may increase susceptibility to infection. here we conducted a phenome-wide mendelian randomization (mr) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ace2 expression in the lung. expression data was based on gtex. we also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in mr analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ace2 expression and may be clinically relevant. notably, mr is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. the most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ace2 expression. based on one of the largest gwas on type ii diabetes (t2dm) to date (n=898,130), we found that t2dm is causally linked to raised ace2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% ci 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49e-4; gsmr method). significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type i and ii diabetes. other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ace2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (er+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated alt, among others. we also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ace2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, vegf signaling, jak-stat signaling etc. we also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the mr analysis. in conclusion, the current mr analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ace2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. the proteome-wide mr analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ace2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this study was

emerged into the human population in wuhan, china. the number of identified cases in wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 january 2020). we fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 january to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from wuhan. we estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (r_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. we estimate that only 5.1% (95%ci, 4.8-5.5) of infections in wuhan are identified, and by 21 january a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in wuhan since the start of the year. should the epidemic continue unabated in wuhan, we predict the epidemic in wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 february (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across china; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 february. our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. with these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-ncov

(2019-ncov) outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. the clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterised, little data are available that describe the disease pathogenesis, and no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist. corticosteroids were widely used during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov 1 and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)-cov, 2 and are being used in patients with 2019-ncov in addition to other therapeutics. 3 however, current interim guidance from who on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection is suspected (released jan 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 4 understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in 2019-ncov is of immediate clinical importance. here we discuss the clinical outcomes of corticosteroid use in coronavirus and similar outbreaks (table). acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are partly caused by host immune responses. corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation but also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. in sars-cov infection, as with influenza, systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. 12 in sars, inflammation persists after viral clearance. 13,14 pulmonary histology in both sars and mers infections reveals inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage, 15 with one report suggesting haemophagocytosis. 16 theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role to suppress lung inflammation. in a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with mers, 2 almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were given corticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalent dose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25, prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. after statistical adjustment for immortal time and indication biases, the authors concluded that administration of corticosteroids was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0\\u00b78, 95% ci 0\\u00b75-1\\u00b71; p=0\\u00b712) but was associated with delayed clearance of viral rna from respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazard ratio 0\\u00b74, 95% ci 0\\u00b72-0\\u00b77; p=0\\u00b70005). however, these effect estimates have a high risk of error due to the probable presence of unmeasured confounders. in a

lombardy (and of all italy). this was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number r0. furthermore, by reducing the estimated transmission rate by 90% on march 8 (to reflect the lockdown of almost all activities), we run the simulator from march 8 to forecast the fade out of the outbreak. findings based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in lombardy on march 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. according to this scenario, the day-zero for the outbreak in lombardy was the 21st of january 2020. the effective per-day disease transmission rate for the period until march 8 was found to be 0.779 (90% ci: 0.777-0.781), while the \\\"effective\\\" per-day mortality rate was found to be 0.0173 (90% ci: 0.0154-0.0192). based on these values, the basic reproduction rate r0 was found to be 4.04 (90% ci: 4.03-4.05). importantly, by reducing the transmission rate by 90% on march 8 to reflect the suspension of almost all activities in italy, we run the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. simulations show that if the measures continue, the complete fade out of the outbreak in lombardy is expected to occur by the end of may 2020. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial not applicable ### funding statement no

coronavirus infection were diagnosed in wuhan, china. due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of china. currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for covid-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. the sars-cov-2 mpro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. to address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the p1 position. we used it to determine the substrate preferences of the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. the results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.']\",\"['deubiquitinating enzymes (dubs) are responsible for removing ubiquitin (ub) from its protein conjugates. dubs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. the lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the c-terminal ub motif or contain ub coupled to a fluorophore (z-lrgg-amc, ub-amc); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. by using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (hycosul) and a defined p2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two dubs\\u2014mers plpro and human uch-l3. based on these results, we designed and synthesized ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (abps) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the c-terminal ub motif. biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered ub-based substrates and probes. using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes ub and ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.']\",\"['overall, 37000 international students from the country of risk of 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) will arrive in south korea. the individuals

covid-19 infection in wuhan has been estimated using imported case counts of international travelers, often under the assumption that all cases in travelers are ascertained. recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the covid-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. we therefore used a bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection efficiency for other countries compared to that of singapore. we estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% hpdi 22% - 64%) of singapore\\u2032s capacity. equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% hpdi 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as singapore. using the second component of the global health security index to stratify country likely detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% hpdi 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% hpdi 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% hpdi 0% - 42%). we conclude that estimates of case counts in wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

infected more than 75,000 individuals and spread to over 20 countries. it is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. methods: we have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight sars-cov-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (cap) patients, and 20 healthy controls. results: the median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in sars-cov-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. the distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). however, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. the microbiota in sars-cov-2 infected patients was similar to those in cap, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. conclusion: sars-cov-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. although how the intra-host

transportation and industry. mass migration prior to the chinese new year may have accelerated the spread of covid-19 across china. this analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from wuhan and the incidence of covid-19 in 31 chinese provinces during january-february 2020. methods: we collected incidence of confirmed covid-19 cases from national and provincial health committee reports from january 10 to february 29, 2020. volume of outbound traffic from wuhan to other provinces was measured by baidu migration index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. we used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and covid-19 incidence by province. contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of covid-19 cases following the travel ban for wuhan. results: cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from wuhan was positively associated with covid-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all p<0.05). approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and covid-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to wuhan and with more passenger influx from wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. we further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 covid-19 cases (95% ci: 13,589, 25,946) outside of wuhan by february 29, 2020. conclusions: outflowing migration from wuhan facilitated the covid-19 transmission to other parts of china with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. the travel ban led to a significant reduction in covid-19 outside of wuhan. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china

wuhan, central china and rapidly spread throughout china. up to march 3, 2020, sars-cov-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in china and other 66 countries across six continents. in this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of sars-cov-2 and combined 136 genomes from gisaid database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. network, ebsp, mismatch, and neutrality tests) in the previous three months. the results showed that eighty haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of sars-cov-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. phylogenetic analysis showed that pangolin may not be an intermediate host. the network indicated that, in the original haplotype (h14), one patient sample lived near the huanan seafood market (approximately 2 km), which indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. however, based on this clue, we cannot accurately conclude that whether this market was the origin center of sars-cov-2. additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term, which would have led to the outbreak of sars-cov-2 in wuhan and other areas. the ebsp results showed that the first estimated expansion date began from 7 december 2019, which indicated that the transmission of sars-cov-2 could have begun from person to person in mid to late november.']\",\"['we analyze the spread of covid-19 by considering the transmission of the disease among individuals both within and between communities. a set of communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g. the u.s. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). covid-19 can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the expected/average number of other communities to which a single infected community will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. we find that this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before community-level action is taken. thus, reductions in travel and the speed at which communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak. the analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not necessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at once, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. the sooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in place. if infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the future) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities (and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will exponentially decrease over time.']\",\"['background since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, multiple efforts of modelling of the geo-temporal transmissibility of the virus have been undertaken, but none succeeded in describing the pandemic at the global level. we propose a set of parameters for the first covid-19 global epidemic and mobility model (gleam). the simulation starting with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in wuhan, china, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 125 days in multiple countries across three continents. methods we have built a modified sir model and parameterized it analytically, according to the literature and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread. we compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixeight selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions. the obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data. findings the parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number r0, ~4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model. interpretation parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both r0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. this is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented covid-19 cases. consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis. ### competing interest

of patients with coronavirus 2019-ncov pneumonia have not previously been described in detail. purpose to investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging coronavirus 2019-ncov pneumonia in humans. materials and methods fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women, 16-76 years old) with 2019-ncov pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody underwent thin-section ct. the imaging findings, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated. results fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of the endemic center wuhan contact. fever (49/51, 96%) and cough (24/51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37/51, 73%), neutrophil count (44/51, 86.3%) and normal (17/51, 35.3%) or reduced (33/51, 64.7%) lymphocyte count. ct images showed pure ground grass opacity (ggo) in 39/51 (77%) patients, ggo with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38/51 (75%) patients. ggo with consolidation was present in 30/51 (59%) and pure consolidation in 28/51 (55%) patients. 44/51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41/51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44/51 (86%) were peripheral. there were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 or more days from disease onset to ct scan versus 4 or fewer days (431/712 lesions vs. 129/612 lesions, p < 0.001). patients more than 50 years old had more consolidated lung lesions than those 50 years or younger (212/470 vs. 198/854, p < 0.001). follow up ct in 13 patients showed improvement in 7 (54%) patients and progression in 4 (31%) patients. conclusions patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground grass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on ct images combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure are highly suspected of 2019-ncov pneumonia.']\",\"['we develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (covid-19) infection using the public available data from the china cdc. this toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a markov sir infectious disease process. we extend the sir model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. we develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. this toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. an r software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are

has subsequently been spread world-widely. as the covid-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (ct) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify covid-19-infected patients by ct images. materials and methods we collected chest ct scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the covid-19 from hospitals of two provinces in china, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based ct diagnosis system (deeppneumonia) was developed to identify patients with covid-19. results the experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the covid-19 patients from others with an excellent auc of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. in addition, our model was capable of discriminating the covid-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an auc of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (ggo) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. the diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. an online server is available for online diagnoses with ct images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/ncov2019. conclusions the established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. these measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of covid-19 in us cities from march 14th through march 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. this means that covid-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. we discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the covid-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also with preserving socioeconomic activity.']\",\"['the recent emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-ncov) has gained a high cover in public media and worldwide news. this caused a viral pneumonia in thousands of people in wuhan, a central city of china. this short communication gives a brief introduction on how the demand for information on this new epidemic is reported through google trends. author draw conclusions on current infodemiological data on 2019-ncov using three main search queries: coronavirus, sars and mers. two approaches are set. first is worldwide perspective, second is chinese perspective. chinese perspective reveals that in china, this disease in the beginning days was more often referred to sars then to general coronaviruses, whereas worldwide, since the beginning is more often referred to coronaviruses.']\",\"['to date, the sars-cov-2 genome has been considered genetically more stable than sars-cov or mers-cov. here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (orf8) of sars-cov-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in singapore. the deletion also removes the orf8 transcription-regulatory sequence (trs), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the n gene. we also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. during the sars-cov outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population, and similar variation has since been observed across sars-related covs in humans and bats. overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in orf8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus. this is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human sars cases possessed an orf8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation. we therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of sars-cov-2.']\",\"['the respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from china and caused more than 1000 death globally since december 2019. this new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) uses the same receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) seventeen years ago. both viruses recognize ace2 through the spike proteins (s-protein) on their surfaces. it was found that the s-protein from the sars coronavirus (sars-cov) bind stronger to ace2 than 2019-ncov. however, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. to address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ace2 and the s-protein from 2019-ncov, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of s-protein from sars-cov by a multiscale simulation method. our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than sars, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. we further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than sars.']\",\"['2019\\u5e7412\\u6708\\u5f00\\u59cb\\uff0c\\u6e56\\u5317\\u7701\\u6b66\\u6c49\\u5e02\\u9646\\u7eed\\u51fa\\u73b0\\u65b0\\u578b\\u51a0\\u72b6\\u75c5\\u6bd2\\uff082019-ncov\\uff09\\u611f\\u67d3\\u75c5\\u4f8b\\uff0c\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u8513\\u5ef6\\u81f3\\u6211\\u56fd\\u5404\\u5730\\u53ca\\u5883\\u5916\\u3002\\u4eba\\u7fa4\\u666e\\u904d\\u6613\\u611f\\uff0c\\u5df2\\u9646\\u7eed\\u53d1\\u73b0\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u75c5\\u4f8b\\u3002\\u53d1\\u70ed\\u4e0d\\u518d\\u662f\\u65e9\\u671f\\u7684\\u4e3b\\u8981\\u8868\\u73b0\\uff0c\\u4e5f\\u53ef\\u8868\\u73b0\\u4e3a\\u4e4f\\u529b\\u3001\\u5e72\\u54b3\\u548c\\u6076\\u5fc3\\u3001\\u5455\\u5410\\u7b49\\u75c7\\u72b6\\uff0c\\u5c11\\u6570\\u611f\\u67d3\\u8005\\u4ee5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u9053\\u75c7\\u72b6\\u4e3a\\u9996\\u53d1\\u8868\\u73b0\\u800c\\u5c31\\u8bca\\u3002\\u5728\\u9f3b\\u54bd\\u62ed\\u5b50\\u3001\\u75f0\\u3001\\u4e0b\\u547c\\u5438\\u9053\\u5206\\u6ccc\\u7269\\u3001\\u8840\\u6db2\\u3001\\u7caa\\u4fbf\\u7b49\\u6807\\u672c\\u4e2d\\u53ef\\u68c0\\u6d4b\\u51fa2019-ncov\\u6838\\u9178\\u3002\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u6d41\\u884c\\u671f\\u95f4\\uff0c\\u539f\\u5219\\u4e0a\\u5982\\u975e\\u5fc5\\u987b\\uff0c\\u5e94\\u63a8\\u8fdf\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u8bca\\u7597\\u3002\\u4f46\\u75c5\\u60c5\\u9700\\u8981\\u6216\\u9700\\u6025\\u8bca\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u8bca\\u7597\\u65f6\\uff0c\\u5e94\\u8ba4\\u771f\\u8bc4\\u4f30\\uff0c\\u638c\\u63e1\\u8bca\\u7597\\u6307\\u5f81\\uff0c\\u505a\\u597d\\u4e2a\\u4eba\\u9632\\u62a4\\uff0c\\u4e25\\u683c\\u6267\\u884c\\u6d88\\u6bd2\\u9694\\u79bb\\u89c4\\u8303\\u3002\\u73b0\\u7ed3\\u5408\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u8bca\\u7597\\u7279\\u70b9\\uff0c\\u5236\\u5b9a\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u6d41\\u884c\\u671f\\u95f4\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u4e2d\\u5fc3\\u5e94\\u5bf92019-ncov\\u611f\\u67d3\\u7684\\u9632\\u63a7\\u65b9\\u6848\\uff0c\\u9632\\u6b62\\u533b\\u9662\\u611f\\u67d3\\u53d1\\u751f\\u3002\\u4ee5\\u671f\\u80fd\\u5bf9\\u513f\\u7ae5\\u6d88\\u5316\\u5185\\u955c\\u4e00\\u7ebf\\u533b\\u52a1\\u4eba\\u5458\\u57282019-ncov\\u6d41\\u884c\\u671f\\u95f4\\u7684\\u5de5\\u4f5c\\u53ca\\u75ab\\u60c5\\u9632\\u63a7\\u8d77\\u5230\\u5efa\\u8bae\\u4e0e\\u6307\\u5bfc\\u4f5c\\u7528\\u3002.']\",\"['background:

the aim of this study was to identify whether sars-cov-2 infected in ocular surface. methods: cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a covid-19 diagnosis, from december 30, 2019 to february 7, 2020, at tongji hospital, tongji medical college, huazhong university of science and technology. demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (rt), chest computed tomography (ct) were took intermittently, and sars-cov-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (rt-pcr) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. results: a total of 102 patients (48 male [50%] and 54 female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, rt, and chest computed tomography (ct) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of covid-19. patients had a mean [sd] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [sd] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with sars-cov-2 rt-pcr assay. only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed covid-19. however, sars-cov-2 rna fragments was found in ocular discharges by sars-cov-2 rt-pcr only in one patient with conjunctivitis. conclusions: although we suspect the incidence of sars-cov-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of sars-cov-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. the inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of sars-cov-2. therefore, to lower the sars-cov-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers. ###

etiologic agent responsible for covid-19 coronavirus disease, is a global threat. to better understand viral tropism, we assessed the rna expression of the coronavirus receptor, ace2, as well as the viral s protein priming protease tmprss2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the human cell atlas consortium. we found that ace2, as well as the protease tmprss2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. in-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ace2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. the skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ace2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. this association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the human cell atlas as a reference dataset. in this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of sars-cov-2 infection. this, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.']\",\"['background: real-time pcr (rt-pcr) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of sars-cov-2. however, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of rt-pcr, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. methods: we explored the feasibility of droplet digital pcr (ddpcr) to detect sars-cov-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with rt-pcr in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical rt-pcr detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. the experiment was double-blind. results: the lower limit of detection of the optimized ddpcr is at least 500 times lower than that of rt-pcr. the overall accuracy of ddpcr for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by rt-pcr were correctly judged by ddpcr based on the follow-up investigation. in addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by rt-pcr were positive by ddpcr detection. conclusions: ddpcr shows superiority for clinical detection of sars-cov-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard rt-pcr. before the ddpcr to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary. ### competing interest

simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. methods: this study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (lym%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of covid-19 patients. next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in covid-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. results: our results from death and severe cases showed that lym% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of covid-19. lym% in patients with moderate covid-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. in contrast, lym% was lower than 20% in severe cases. however, lym% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. therefore, we established a reliable time from symptom onset-lym% model (tlm), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with covid-19. conclusion: lymphopenia can be used to indicate clinical course, treatment effect and outcomes of covid-19 patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest.

immunoglobulin (ig) domain proteins, including orf8 and orf7a from sars-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain alpha-covs. among them, orf8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among sars-cov-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. we also uncover many ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which

(2019-ncov) infection has been quickly spreading out to other provinces and neighboring countries. estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. a deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. the estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% ci 5.71\\u20137.23). sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by wuhan on 2019-ncov infection in beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. it is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-ncov infection, and how long they should be maintained. under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 january 2020) with a significant low peak value. with travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.']\",\"['the basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a na\\u00efve, uninfected population. it is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. with the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-ncov need to be revised. by using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until january 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. we estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. the epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.']\",\"['we conducted a comparative study of covid-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland china, the guangdong province of china and south korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. we estimated the initial basic reproduction number for south korea, the guangdong province and mainland china as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (ci): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%ci: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%ci: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. we found that the effective reproduction number for the guangdong province and mainland china has fallen below the threshold 1 since february 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for south korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. we also project the epidemic trend in south korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in china is used. we show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in china and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the covid-19 epidemic in south korea. the experience of outbreak control in mainland china should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including south korea. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding ### author declarations all relevant

due to the spring festival, resulting in an epidemic in the other provinces including the shaanxi province. the epidemic scale in shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in xian. we could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. this calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the shaanxi province have been effective. risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between january 10th and february 4th 2020. however, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. we believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this research was funded by

respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. compared with sars and ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. traditional seir (susceptibility-exposure-infection-removal) there are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the spring festival before and after the chinese spring festival.it is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. methods the traditional seir model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. the transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. therefore, this article first establishes a modified seir model. predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. results the first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in wuhan on december 8, 2019. when wuhan city took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; if wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on january 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on january 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on january 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. if wuhan city is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. conclusions comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the wuhan municipal government on january 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic prevention and control play a vital role. wearing a

a travel history in wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from wuhan. for the patients who was returnees from wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. in different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1/31/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among sars-cov-2 infected patient was higher(19% vs 1.5%). in different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14,

with new cases of covid-19 surging around the world, some countries may have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. methods: we developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to covid-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. findings: for fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. a large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. for slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. interpretation: handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about covid-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. we stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing covid-19

pathogenesis and vaccine development. large rna virus genomes, such as from coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in e. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability. therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for rna viruses would benefit the research community. here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse rna viruses, including members of the coronaviridae, flaviviridae and paramyxoviridae families. viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral dna, clinical samples, or synthetic dna, and reassembled in one step in saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (tar) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (yac). t7-rna polymerase has been used to generate infectious rna, which was then used to rescue viable virus. based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic sars-cov-2 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic dna fragments. the technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving rna virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.']\",\"['we report the kinetics of the immune response

measures for returning citizens, many countries implemented pcr screening to test for infection regardless of symptoms. these flights therefore give estimates of infection prevalence in wuhan over time. between 30 th january and 1 st february (close to the peak of the epidemic in wuhan), infection prevalence was 0.87% (95% ci: 0.32%-1.89%). as countries now start to repatriate citizens from iran and northern italy, information from repatriated citizens could help inform the level of response necessary to help control the outbreaks unfolding in newly affected areas. 1. background following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (covid-19, formerly 2019-ncov) in wuhan city, china and the subsequent travel and movement restrictions implemented in the city, foreign governments began the process of chartering flights to repatriate citizens from the epicentre of the outbreak. these flights began on 29th january 2020 and continued throughout february with the last flight returning on 27 th february 2020. in addition to quarantining citizens returning on these flights to prevent any potential secondary transmission after arrival, many countries implemented pcr screening of returning citizens to test for infection. these repatriation flights therefore provide snapshots of the infection prevalence over time and insights into the levels of transmission in wuhan city. we present an overview of these repatriation flights within this timeframe. information on: i) the number of individuals repatriated; ii) their destination country; iii) whether individuals were tested for the pathogen responsible for covid-19 regardless of symptoms; iv) and their outcomes where available were sourced from publicly available sources. these are provided in a supplementary data

caused by the novel coronavirus 2019-ncov in wuhan, hubei province of china, at the end of 2019 shaped tremendous challenges to', \\\"china's\\\", 'public health and clinical treatment. the virus belongs to the beta genus coronavirus in the family corornaviridae, and is closely related to sars-cov and mers-cov, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. the virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. according to current observations, 2019-ncov is weaker than sars in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence;', \\\"it's\\\", 'mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace2), which is consistent with the receptor sars-cov. after the outbreak of this disease, chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. the emergence of 2019-ncov reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. it also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.']\",\"['an ongoing outbreak of a novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) was first reported in china and has spread worldwide. on january 23rd 2020 china shut down transit in and out of wuhan, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million

(95% ci: 2.54-3.29). this delay provided time to establish and reinforce other control measures that are essential to halt the epidemic. the ongoing dissemination of 2019-ncov provides an opportunity to examine how travel restrictions impede the spatial dispersal of an emerging infectious disease. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

views, there is growing literature on pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contributing significantly to the disease outbreak. several recent studies on serial infection yielded a mean interval of around 4 days, shorter than the mean symptom onset time of 5-7 days, and negative serial interval in more than 10% of the cases. these observations highlight the urgent need to quantify the pre-symptomatic transmission for adequate global response. in this paper, we develop an epidemic model driven by pre-symptomatic transmission. within the model construct, the infectiousness of a viral carrier on a given day is identified with their symptom onset probability, which we characterise through extensive studies of the clinical literature. the well-known lotka-euler estimating equation can then be invoked to relate the daily growth rate $\\\\\\\\lambda$ of the epidemic with the basic reproduction number $r_0$. we applied the disease spreading model to epidemic development in affected provinces across china following the wuhan lockdown on january 23, 2020. the remarkable three-phase universal pattern can be well-captured by the model. despite its simplicity, the model allows synthesis of data from diverse sources to form a quantitative understanding of key mechanisms that drive or contain the disease spreading, and to make informed decisions to bring the pandemic under control.']\",\"['the newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has caused more than 800 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 25 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (rbd) in 2019-ncov and sars-cov, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-sars-cov antibodies with 2019-ncov spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-ncov. here, we report for the first time that a sars-cov-specific human monoclonal antibody, cr3022, could bind potently with 2019-ncov rbd (kd of 6.3 nm). the epitope of cr3022 does not overlap with the ace2 binding site within 2019-ncov rbd. therefore, cr3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-ncov infections. interestingly, some of the most potent sars-cov-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, cr3014) that target the ace2 binding site of sars-cov failed to bind 2019-ncov spike protein, indicating that the difference in the rbd of sars-cov and 2019-ncov has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-ncov rbd.']\",\"['abstractthe newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has caused more than

to quantify values of key variables that determine the transmission and the effort required to control the epidemic. we determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for

singapore and tianjin, china, reported from jan.19-feb.26 and jan.21-feb.27, respectively. we estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. results: the mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for tianjin. both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. the mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for tianjin. we inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (singapore, tianjin). the estimated basic reproduction number for singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. conclusions: estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both singapore and tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of r0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement cc and js

writing. during the interval between february 19 and 23, 2020, iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. three exported cases originating in iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. a large epidemic in iran could further fuel global dissemination of covid-19. we sought to estimate covid-19 outbreak size in iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in iran may spread to next. we assessed interconnectivity between iran and other countries using using international air transport association (iata) data. we used the methods of fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the united arab emirates (uae), lebanon, and canada. time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to iran derived from the united nations world tourism organization (unwto). we evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with iran, and destination country rankings on the infectious disease vulnerability index (idvi), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. uae, lebanon, and canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from iran in february 2019. we estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) covid-19 cases would have had to occur in iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in syria, azerbaijan and iraq. even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the \\\"best case\\\" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% ci: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of covid-19 with origin in iran (such as canada), it is likely that iran is currently experiencing a covid-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. this is concerning, both for public health in iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics. ### competing interest statement drs. khan and watts, and mr. sherbo, are employees of bluedot, a health. dr. bogoch is a paid consultant to

the interval between february 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of covid-19 reported in 21 countries in europe, africa, north america, and south america which were either in individuals with recent travel from italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from italy 2. in six cases, in four of the affected countries (switzerland, france, austria, croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. we used air travel volume between italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the international air transport association (iata) for february 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from italy). we used the methods of fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. to estimate the time at risk of covid-19 exposure for travelers departing italy, we obtained data from the united nations world tourism organization (unwto) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to italy (3.4 days), and assumed the italian epidemic began one month prior to february 29, 2020. we also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. when all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% ci 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on february 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. in sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). we recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. the reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from italy, relative to iran. in summary, we suggest that the numerous covid-19 case exportations from italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in south korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of february 29, 2020. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement funded by canadian institutes for health research covid-19 rapid research fund. ###

patients were males. the mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. either ground glass opacity ggo or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had no ggo or consolidation. the other rare ct symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. the most prevalent event was either ggo or consolidation in 85% of patients. conclusion: the most ct-scan abnormality is either ground glass opacity ggo or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just ct findings will lead to miss some patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding

whereas the incidence in other asian countries, in europe and north america remains low so far.']\",\"['a novel coronavirus recently identified in wuhan, china (2019-ncov) has expanded the number of highly pathogenic coronaviruses affecting humans. the 2019-ncov represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection. the present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. the performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging 2019-ncov is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov and, to a lesser degree, middle east respiratory syndrome (mers)-cov. moreover, the well-known sars-cov receptor (ace2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of 2019-ncov; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the 2019-ncov, and that domain 288-330 of s1 protein from the 2019-ncov represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target.']\",\"['background: a range of case fatality ratio (cfr) estimates for covid 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. methods: we used individual-case data from mainland china and cases detected outside mainland china to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). we next obtained age-stratified estimates of the cfr by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in china, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. we additionally estimated the cfr from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland china. we used data on the pcr prevalence in international residents repatriated from china at the end of january 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (ifr). using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from china, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. findings: we estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, cri 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% cri 21.1,24.4 days). we estimate a crude cfr of 3.67% (95% cri 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland china. adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in wuhan relative to the rest of china, we obtain a best estimate of the cfr in china of 1.38% (95% cri 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. our estimate of the cfr from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from china. we obtain an overall ifr estimate for china of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. interpretation: these early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of covid-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by

reportedly decreased in china and south korea, it still exhibit significant growth in italy and other countries across europe. in this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. instead of the classical sir model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\\\\\\\\mathcal{r}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard sir model. if $\\\\\\\\mathcal{r}_0 >1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. however, if $\\\\\\\\mathcal{r}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. we then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). analysis of the data in china and korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. during this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. however, the growth rate remains exponential in italy. arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.']\",\"['until 24:00 of february 7th 2020, 31774 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) infection have been reported, including 6101 severe cases in critical conditions and 722 deaths. the critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. it has been recently known that the 2019-ncov shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (sars-cov). thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on sars which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in sars but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-ncov (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. the computerized tomography (ct) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-ncov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-ncov patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (crrt) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no

diversity. bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods indicate that the virus was introduced into the human population in early december and has an epidemic doubling time of approximately seven days. phylodynamic modelling provides an estimate of epidemic size through time. precise estimates of epidemic size are not possible with current genetic data, but our analyses indicate evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections caused by each case, as indicated by a high level of over-dispersion in the reproduction number. larger numbers of more

of the virus in mainland china excluding hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. methods: a novel covid-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention

indeed effective and magnificently suppressed covid-19 transmission. moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. by calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of

questionnaire,from february 15, 2020 to february 21, 2020. the questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, cml diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have covid-19. we described and analyzed the prevalence of covid-19 in cml patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of covid-19 patients. data were compared between the cml patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. the primary outcome was prevalence of covid-19 in cml patients, as of feb 21, 2020. secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of cml patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of cml patients with covid-19 . findings of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. in the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with covid-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with covid-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with covid-19. of the 50 patients who failed to respond to cml treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of covid-19. interpretation while the 392 cml respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with covid-19 patients during the outbreak. patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to cml therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with sars-cov-2. older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work was supported by

information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. objective: to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of ncip. design, setting, and participants: retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed ncip at zhongnan hospital of wuhan university in wuhan, china, from january 1 to january 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was february 3, 2020. exposures: documented ncip. main outcomes and measures: epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. results: of 138 hospitalized patients with ncip, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 \\u00d7 109/l [interquartile range {iqr}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [iqr, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 u/l [iqr, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (icu) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). the median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ards was 8.0 days. patients treated in the icu (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the icu (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). of the 36 cases in the icu, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). as of february 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (iqr, 7.0-14.0). conclusions and relevance: in this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed ncip in wuhan, china, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-ncov was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received icu care, and mortality was 4.3%.']\",\"['background. the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (covid-19) has attracted global attention. in the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two \\\\\\\\``zero\\\" points, respectively. unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. method. to address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two \\\\\\\\``zero\\\" points. then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the covid-19 using the public available data for mainland china beyond hubei province from the china centers for disease control (cdc) during the period of jan 29th, 2020, to feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. results. results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. the first prediction results on jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland china beyond hubei province would appear on jan 31st and feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late march, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-march and mid-april in mainland china beyond hubei province. the framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where covid-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the authors are grateful for the financial support

province, china, in december 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) is the receptor for sars-cov and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-ncov. paradoxically, ace2 expression in the lung protects mice from sars-cov spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. in the intestine, ace2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. upon analysis of single cell-rna sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), we found that ace2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. in summary, we suggest that ace2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-ncov infection.competing interest statementthe authors have declared no competing interest.funding statementthe national natural science

aimed to explore the effects of sars-cov-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized covid-19-confirmed patients. methods 116 hospitalized covid-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the department of infectious diseases, renmin hospital of wuhan university from january 14 to february 13, 2020. the recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (ct) scans, and treatment measures. sars-cov-2 rna in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time rt-pcr. findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 covid-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. in addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (crf) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (crrt) were confirmed infection of sars-cov-2, and diagnosed as covid-19. beside the treatment of covid-19, crrt was also applied three times weekly. the course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of crf, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. all 5 patients with crf were survived. moreover, sars-cov-2 rna in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for sars-cov-2 orf 1ab from 5 cases with crf. interpretation acute renal impairment was uncommon in covid-19. sars-cov-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate crf in the covid-19 patients. ### competing interest statement the authors have

confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by covid-19 in the world from january 20 to february 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in january. then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. results there were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in china and 26 overseas countries. in total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from hubei province. the lgn rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72\\u2103 and then slowly declined. the apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70\\u2103 and 12.42\\u2103 respectively. the curves shared similar shapes. under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1\\u2103 increase in

2019-novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) outbreaks create challenges for hospital laboratories because thousands of samples must be evaluated each day. sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. the possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-ncov and co-infections. methods: we used a fluorescence-based quantitative pcr kit urgently distributed by the chinese cdc to detect 8274 close contacts in the wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-ncov genome. we also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-ncov. findings: among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-ncov infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-ncov nucleic acid test (non-019-ncov); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-ncov-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. the positive rates of ncov-np and ncovorf1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. ncov-np-positive only and ncovorf1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. in the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-ncov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza a virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza a h3n2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza a virus (11/202), influenza a h3n2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza b virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). interpretation: clinical testing methods for 2019-ncov require improvement.

receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) for entering into host cells. the affinity between ace2 and 2019-ncov s is much higher than ace2 binding to sars-cov s protein, explaining that why 2019-ncov seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. here, we reported that ace2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including sars-cov and

covid-19 occurred in wuhan, hubei province, china. in a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over china, greatly threatening public health and economic development. the chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. we therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these chinese strategies for controlling the spread of covid-19. methods: from the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial health commission websites of china, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. we further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (speedmax). comparing different times to speedmax of different areas in china, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. also, the number of plateaus were analyzed. results: the quartic model showed the best fit. for almost all areas in mainland china, the speed of infections reached speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were hebei, heilongjiang, hainan, guizhou, and hubei. the number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. however, the distance from other areas to hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at speedmax. once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of covid-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over china. conclusion: our study suggests that chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. these strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the covid-19

orders of magnitude. we aim to provide a precise estimate of the cfr of covid-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. methods: we extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the national health commission p. r. china from 20 jan 2020, to 22 feb 2020. competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death

77,041 cases were diagnosed as covid-19 in china. the cfr of covid-19 were estimated to be 7.24% (95% ci: 6.61%-8.01%) in hubei province, including wuhan, the epicenter, and 1.00% (95% ci:

china, over 7 times in all estimation. the cfr would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, cfr estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding was

patients infected with covid-19 (the novel coronavirus) based on breathing characteristics. according to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of covid-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. one significant symptom that occurs in the covid-19 is tachypnea. people infected with covid-19 have more rapid respiration. our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. research details: accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. in this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. the challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. in this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient respiratory simulation model (rsm) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. subsequently, we first apply a gru neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (bi-at-gru) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (eupnea, tachypnea, bradypnea, biots, cheyne-stokes and central-apnea). the proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.']\",\"['severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers) coronaviruses (covs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (s) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. coronavirus s proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 n-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on mers s that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on sars and hku1 covs. we provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including hiv-1 envelope, lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class i viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.']\",\"['the recent epidemic of coronavirus (covid-19) that started in china has

phase. the data available at the johns hopkins university site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. all the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in china. on the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, italy, iran,

2020)- seems to follow the same path. we calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. we identify clearly different

enforced in china and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. we estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the covid-19 outbreak. our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single sars cov-2 case from mainland china via international travel exceeded 95% on january 13, 2020. we found that 779 cases (95% ci: 632 to 967) would have been exported by february 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the chinese government averted 70.5% (95% ci: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. in addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% ci:

of multiple new taxonomic categories including both subfamilies and subgenera for coronaviruses (family coronaviridae , subfamily orthocoronavirinae ) represents a major shift in how official classifications are used to designate specific viral lineages. while the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. we infer bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. we thus propose that partial rdrp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the r package, \\u201cmycov\\u201d, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution. importance statement the analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as coronaviruses. recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains.

the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. methods: we studied viral load courses by rt-pcr in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. infectious virus was detected by cell culture. active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. results: seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. clinical sensitivity of rt-pcr on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. average viral load was 6.76x10e5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral rna. shedding of viral rna from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. seroconversion occurred after about one week. conclusions: the present study shows that covid-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. sars-cov-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. these findings

of 2019n-cov is of great concern to the global community. the fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. during such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. we aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-ncov outbreak. methods an anonymous internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on january 29, 2020. the study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of hubei, where wuhan is the capital city. the level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. findings the majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. a high uptake of 2019-ncov preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [or] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (or = 2.23, 95% ci 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. the majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-cov. few of the participants from wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. similarly, being under quarantine (or = 2.36, 95% ci 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (or = 2.20, 95% ci 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. interpretation the results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. in view of the 2019-ncov being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services. funding national key r&d program of china, ningbo health branding subject fund, sanming project of medicine in shenzhen, k.c. wong magna fund in ningbo university, national natural

a single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 covid-19 patients admitted from december 25, 2019 to january 27, 2020 in wuhan jinyintan hospital, china; follow up was completed on february 11, 2020. exposures: high levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-tni; ck; ck-mb; ldh; \\u03b1-hbdh). main outcomes and measures: mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). results: of 188 patients with covid-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. increased hs-tni levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). high hs-tni on admission (\\u2265 6.126 pg/ml), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/ml), already can be associated with higher mortality. high hs-tni was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, il-6, crp, and pct) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and cd4+ and cd8+ t cells). ck was not associated with mortality. increased ck-mb levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. high ck-mb on admission was associated with higher mortality. high ck-mb was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. increased ldh and \\u03b1-hbdh levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. both high ldh and \\u03b1-hbdh on admission were associated with higher mortality. both high ldh and \\u03b1-hbdh were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-tni level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% ci= -0.64~-0.12, p=0.005). ldh level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% ci= -0.59~-0.05, p=0.022). conclusions and relevance: heart injury signs arise in covid-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. covid-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. high levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. covid-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because covid-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury. ### competing interest statement

up to 25th of january 2020, at least 1,975 cases have been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on the 12th of december 2019. epidemiological investigation suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in wuhan. we studied one patient who was a worker at the market, and who was admitted to wuhan central hospital on 26th of december 2019 experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, dizziness and cough. metagenomic rna sequencing(4) of a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample identified a novel rna virus from the family coronaviridae, designed here as wh-human-1 coronavirus. phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of sars-like coronaviruses (genus betacoronavirus, subgenus sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in china. this outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.']\",\"['to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the facemask shortage during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19) outbreak in china. we have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the chinese governments during the outbreaks. by considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-december 2019 to late-april 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. our findings showed that if the covid-19 outbreak occurred only in wuhan city or hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. however, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of china, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. supplies of facemasks in the whole of china would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the covid-19 outbreak only occurred in wuhan city or hubei province. however, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of china, facemask supplies in china could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 apr 2020. assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of april. in light of the covid-19 outbreak in china, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov). cases have been exported to other chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from wuhan to cities outside mainland china and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. methods we used data from dec 31, 2019, to jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from dec 25, 2019, to jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in wuhan from dec 1, 2019, to jan 25, 2020. cases exported domestically were then estimated. we forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-ncov, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of wuhan and surrounding cities, which began jan 23-24, 2020. we used data on monthly flight bookings from the official aviation guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland china from the tencent database. data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the chinese center for disease control and prevention. serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov). a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in china. the basic reproductive number was estimated using markov chain monte carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (cri). findings in our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-ncov was 2\\u00b768 (95% cri 2\\u00b747-2\\u00b786) and that 75 815 individuals (95% cri 37 304-130 330) have been infected in wuhan as of jan 25, 2020. the epidemic doubling time was 6\\u00b74 days (95% cri 5\\u00b78-7\\u00b71). we estimated that in the baseline scenario, chongqing, beijing, shanghai, guangzhou, and shenzhen had imported 461 (95% cri 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from wuhan, respectively. if the transmissibility of 2019-ncov were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of china with a lag time behind the wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. interpretation given that 2019-ncov is no longer contained within wuhan, other major chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. large cities overseas with close transport links to china could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally. funding health and medical research fund (hong kong, china).']\",\"['background: the covid-19 has been successfully contained in china but is spreading all over the world. we use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in china and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. we use the experience from china to analyze the calibration results on japan, south korea, iran, italy and europe, and make future scenario projections. methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized richards model to the reported number of infected cases from jan. 19 to march 10 for the whole of china, 29 provinces in china, four severely affected countries and europe as a whole. the different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. results: we quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in china with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. based on chinese experience, we identify a high risk in japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of march 25 being 1574 (95% ci: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% ci: [988, 11340]) by june. for south korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% ci: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. we estimate 0.15% (95% ci: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. we would expect 114867 people infected in europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% european population. conclusions: the extreme containment measures implemented by china were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. for other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. japan and italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak

by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has broken out in wuhan, hubei province, china. the continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in china. we managed to forecast the infection peak time in hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. methods: we used data resource according to cases reported by the national health commission of the', \\\"people's\\\", 'republic of china (jan 25, 2019, to feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in wuhan on subsequent days. medical observation, discharge, infected, non-severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in hubei province will occur. also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is april 6-april 14. the numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. results: in very optimistic scenarios (daily ncc decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around february 23-february 26. at the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. in a relative optimistic scenario (daily ncc decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around february 28-march 2. the numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. in a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily ncc decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of march. estimated time is april 6-april 14. the numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. we are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. there should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. in that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. if that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. conclusion: we can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. assisting critical care resources in hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement

respiratory syndrome (sars)-related coronaviruses (e.g., 2019-ncov and sars-cov) are phylogenetically distantly related, but both are capable of infecting human hosts via the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and cause similar clinical and pathological features, suggesting their phenotypic convergence. yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-ncov and sars-cov. further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (rbd) of the spike protein between covid-19 and sars-related cov clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their rbd protein sequences. in addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, orf3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between covid-19 and sars-related cov, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. finally, it should be noted that many observed bat sars-like covs that have an evolutionary convergent rbd sequence with 2019-ncov and sars-cov may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ace2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.']\",\"['we found, in our 788 confirmed covid-19 patients, the decreased rate of severe/critical type, increased liver/kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity during virus dissemination, when compared with wuhan. to investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of sars- cov-2 (zj01) in mild covid-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. further phylogenetic analysis and rscu heat map results suggested that zj01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of sars-cov-2. we classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (c/t type) based on the base (c or t) at positions 8824 and 28247. zj01 were both t at these two sites, becoming the only tt type currently identified in the world. the prediction of furin cleavage site (fcs) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that fcs may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. zj01 had mutations near fcs (f1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the s protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of furin. single cell sequencing and ace2-furin co-expression results confirmed that furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while fcs may help sars-cov-2 infect these organs. the evolutionary pattern of sars-cov-2 towards fcs formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to hku-1 and oc43 (the source of fcs sequence-prra) caused influenza, further showing

caused by sars-cov-2 infection in wuhan, china has posed a serious threat to global public health. to develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. therefore, we herein used a sars-cov-2 spike (s) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that sars-cov-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of sars-cov. we solved the x-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-hb) core of the hr1 and hr2 domains in sars-cov-2 s protein s2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the hr1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with hr2 domain. we previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, ek1, which targeted hr1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including sars-cov and mers-cov. we then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the ek1c4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against sars-cov-2 s protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with ic50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nm, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of ek1 peptide, respectively. ek1c4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including sars-cov and mers-cov, as well as sarsr-covs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including sars-cov-2. intranasal application of ek1c4 before or after challenge with hcov-oc43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that ek1c4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating sars-cov-2 and emerging sarsr-covs.']\",\"['background: the ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 (covid-19) in

unprecedent public health challenges to both china and the rest world. the new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to sars-cov and a newly identified bat coronavirus. while bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-ncov has other hosts is still ambiguous. in this study, one coronavirus isolated from malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-ncov in the e, m, n and s genes, respectively. in particular, the receptor-binding domain of the s protein of the pangolin-cov is virtually identical to that of 2019-ncov, with one amino acid difference. comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-ncov might have originated from the recombination of a pangolin-cov-like virus with a bat-cov-ratg13-like virus. infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the s protein of 2019-ncov. the isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-ncov in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-ncov. the newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.']\",\"['the novel coronavirus (ncov-2019) outbreak in wuhan, china has spread rapidly nationwide, with some cases

assays. the latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. however, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (elisa) for specific igm and igg antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary

the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (huo-yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. there was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. methods: we integrated public data released by the health commission of hubei province and huo-yan laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. results: without the establishment of huo-yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of \\\"daily settlement\\\" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. if the huo-yan laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the hubei lockdown, \\\"daily settlement\\\" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. conclusions: large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. such infrastructure like huo-yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest.

we conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in qingdao and wuhan from january 17 to february 16, 2020. indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific igm antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. results: of the 68 patients with sars-cov-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from qingdao. the median age of qingdao and wuhan patients were 50 (iqr: 37-59) and 31 (iqr: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female

in wuhan had positive results for serum igm antibody detection (p<0.0001). the most common respiratory pathogens detected in qingdao covid-19 patients were influenza virus a (60.00%) and influenza virus b (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). while the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. interpretation: we reported a large proportion of covid-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in qingdao, northeast china, which differed greatly from the patients in wuhan, central china. precautions are needed when dealing with covid-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory

(daa) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new daa drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. thus, host-targeting antiviral (hta) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of dhodh, s312 and s416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various rna viruses, including influenza a virus (h1n1, h3n2, h9n2), zika virus, ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus sars-cov-2. our results are the first to validate that dhodh is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in dhodh knocking-out cells. we also proposed the drug combination of daa and hta was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that s312 showed more advantageous than oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. notably, s416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an ec50 of 17nm and si value >5882 in sars-cov-2-infected cells so far. this work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (leflunomide/teriflunomide) with dual

we analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized covid-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). we collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes.

top-level response nationwide. we developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (o2o) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. methods in this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected covid-19 patients who underwent home isolation in wuhan between january 6 and january 31, 2020. by wechat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. the clinical indications such as fever, muscle soreness, dyspnea and lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. findings the mean(sd) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(\\u22658805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, p<0.04). all inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their ct results at initial diagnosis. the body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. while dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. the lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. interpretation monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. the system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. this type of o2o, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff. ###

outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-ncov) has infected tens of thousands of patients in china. studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-ncov infection, but appeared unsuccessful. farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. therefore, we used and validated a model based on farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-ncov infection in china and 2 regions of high-incidence. methods: we extracted the 2019-ncov incidence data of china, hubei province and wuhan city from websites of the chinese and hubei health commissions. a model based on farr law was developed using the data available on feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-ncov infection in china, hubei province and wuhan city afterward. results: we observed 50,995 (37001 on or before feb. 8) incident cases in china from january 16 to february 15, 2020. the daily-incidence has peaked in china, hubei providence and wuhan city, but with different downward slopes. if no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-ncov will drop to single-digit by february 25 for china and hubei province, but by march 8 for wuhan city. however, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. the predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of

in wuhan, hubei and spread to all provinces in china and other countries. shenzhen ranked the top cities outside wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by february 20, 2020. here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of covid-19 in shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of covid-19 in shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from january 19 to january 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from january 29 to february 5 and the decline phase since february 6. in the three phases, the number of patients from hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. the newly diagnosed covid-19 cases reached its peak around january 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at shenzhen. a series of early preventive strategies were implemented since january 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in shenzhen. all the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab pcr detection of coronavirus 2019, chest ct and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of covid-19. observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at shenzhen from hubei was implemented in february 2. after the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the covid-19 cases started to decline since february 6. there were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in shenzhen. in conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as covid-19, in nearby province of hubei, shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into shenzhen city. the implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in shenzhen were successful in early identification of covid-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in shenzhen. early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in shenzhen. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement this work

without pneumonia,sars-cov-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. methods: we collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed covid-19 patients admitted to pla general hospital. cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. the last follow-up was february 18, 2020. results:we characterized 55 consecutive covid-19 patients. the mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [ci], 6.55-10.29) days. the mean sars-cov-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%ci, 8.21-11.22) days. covid-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. asymptomatic carriers might transmit sars-cov-2. compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/ml, p=0.040), b lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, p=0.024), low account (<190/\\u03bcl) of cd8+ t cells (33.3% vs. 0, p=0.019). multivariate cox regression

forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. however, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of covid-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. in this paper, based on the public covid-19 data of seven provinces/cities in china reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. we highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. we further introduce the akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. we further notice the logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the', \\\"gomertz's\\\", 'function makes an overestimation in all cases. since the methods of sequential bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. the transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. towards the dynamical models based on odes, it is observed that the seir-qd and seir-po models generally show a better performance than sir, seir and seir-ahq models on the covid-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the authors acknowledged the financial supports

occurred during sars-cov-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. in this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 covid-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in covid-19 cases. moreover, ip-10, mcp-3, and il-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the pao2/fao2 and murray score. furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of covid-19, and the combination of ip-10, mcp-3 and il-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (auc) of the receiver-operating characteristics (roc) calculations. serial detection of ip-10, mcp-3 and il-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. in

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) first broke out in wuhan (china) and subsequently spread worldwide. chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating sars-cov-2 infection. hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. we propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill sars-cov-2 infected patients. currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in sars-cov-2 infection. methods: the pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using sars-cov-2 infected vero cells. physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (pbpk) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. using the pbpk models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations

can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. we focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the chinese lunar new year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (covid-19). we first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. when flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. these movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. we characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 lunar new year due to travel restrictions. travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. these results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level.']\",\"['abstract background the covid-19 epidemic, first emerged in wuhan during december 2019, has spread globally. while the mass population movement for chinese new year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in china. methods', \\\"spearman's\\\", 'correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed covid-19 cases from jan 20th to feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. results there were 74,675 confirmed covid-19 cases in china by feb 19th, 2020. the overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). the index of population inflow from hubei was positively correlated with total (provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; city r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; city r=0.6358, p<0.001). the local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. conclusions the spread of the covid-19 in china in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain covid-19 in china. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by sf12 as well as distress (k6). the severity of the covid-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. interpretation our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically. we need to support especially people who suspended working during the outbreak. our results also highlight that people who are usually active, as indicated by more exercises, might be more suspectable to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown. policymakers who are thinking of introducing measures to contain covid-19 may benefit from understanding such health and welling implications. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial not applicable ### funding statement we

discrete dynamic model for human epidemics was developed in present study. the model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period,

cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. the total cumulative cases significantly decreased with decline of transmission strength and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate. in a certain range, the total cumulative cases significantly increased with mean incubation period. sensitivity analysis demonstrated that dynamic change of transmission strength is one of the most important and controllable factors. in addition, reducing the delay for hospitalization is much effective in weakening disease epidemic. non-hospitalization recovery rate is of importance for enhancing immunity to recover from the disease.']\",\"['the ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a

expensive instrumentation. here we report a method to identify sars-cov-2 (covid-19) virus rna from purified rna or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) using a visual, colorimetric detection. this test was additionally verified using rna samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from covid-19 patients in wuhan, china with equivalent performance to a commercial rt-qpcr test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. this simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement

all existing models. in this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of covid-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in mainland china. we find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in mainland china, (4) it is expected

international concern with a very high risk of spread and impact at the global level. we developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (seiqr) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. as of jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-ci: 379.8~381.0). with 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in wuhan and hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-ci: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-ci: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-ci: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-ci: 1.56~1.76). we found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland china. the number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of feb 23, 2020. however, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. to minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective. ### competing interest

disease 2019 (covid-19) is rapidly spreading over china and more than 30 countries in last two months. covid-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. we develop a model suqc to adequately characterizes the dynamics of covid-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. the suqc model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of covid-19 in wuhan, hubei (excluding wuhan), china (excluding hubei) and four first-tier cities of china. we find that, before january 30, 2020, all these regions except beijing have a reproductive number r>1, and after january 30, all regions have a reproductive number r<1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting covid-19. the confirmation rate of wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of hubei (excluding wuhan) and 0.2189 of china (excluding hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. the un-quarantined infected individuals in wuhan on february 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on february 21th, 2020. after fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of covid-19 of wuhan and hubei are around late-march, of china (excluding hubei) around mid-march, and of the four tier-one cities before march 2020. a total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from wuhan, 17,679 from hubei(excluding wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of china (excluding hubei). we suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before march in beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and shenzhen, and before late-march in hubei. the model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as south korea, japan and iran. ### competing

ct findings and the clinical conditions of covid-19 pneumonia. materials and methods. data on 101 cases of covid-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in hunan, china. basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). results. patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. most patients with covid-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (ggo) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed ggo and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). lesions present on ct images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and ct involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. conclusion. patients with confirmed covid-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. most patients with covid-19 pneumonia have ggo or mixed ggo and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. ct involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.']\",\"['background: recently, coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) outbreak started in wuhan, china. although the clinical features of covid-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. objectives: to summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. methods: the pubmed, web of science core collection, embase, cochrane and medrxiv databases were searched through february 25, 2020. meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (moose) recommendations were followed. we extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed covid-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. heterogeneity was evaluated using the i2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. results: a total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with covid-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% ci, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. the pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% ci, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% ci, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. the predictor for disease severity included old age (\\u2265 50 yrs, odds ratio [or] = 2.61; 95% ci, 2.29-2.98), male (or =1.348, 95% ci, 1.195-1.521), smoking (or =1.734, 95% ci, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (or = 2.635, 95% ci, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (ckd, or = 6.017; 95% ci,

resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in china, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-ncov was reported to share the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), with sars-cov. here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell rna-seq technique, we analyzed the ace2 rna expression profile in the normal human lungs. the result indicates that the ace2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type ii alveolar cells (at2). surprisingly, we found that this population of ace2-expressing at2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. a comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the asian male one has an extremely large number of ace2-expressing cells in the lung. this study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-ncov infection disease, and could be

recovered - seafood market (seiarw) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). the susceptible people from wuhan city were divided into different age groups. we used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: <= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: >= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: <= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3:

age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (sar). results: the age-specific seiarw model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (\\u03c72 = 4.99 \\u00d7 10-6, p > 0.999), and five age groups (\\u03c72 = 4.85 \\u00d7 10-6, p > 0.999). based on the four-age-group seiarw model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (sar23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (sar32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). the lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) originating from wuhan, china, draws worldwide concerns due to its long incubation period and strong infectivity. although rt-pcr-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. to address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (pc)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcmnps), and the development of pcmnps-based viral rna extraction method for the sensitive detection of covid-19 causing virus, the sars-cov-2. this method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcmnps-rna complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent rt-pcr reactions. the simplified process can purify viral rna from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. by identifying two different regions (orflab and n gene) of viral rna, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 100,000 copies of sars-cov-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of covid-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.']\",\"['the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) infection began in december 2019 in wuhan, and rapidly spread to many

clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. of the 75 patients with covid-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to wuhan. common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. the most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (lym%), decreased cd4+ and cd8+ t cell counts, elevated c-reactive protein (crp) and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). patients with elevated interleukin 6 (il-6) showed significant decreases in the lym%, cd4+ and cd8+ t cell counts. besides, the percentage of neutrophils, crp, ldh and procalcitonin levels increased significantly. we concluded that covid-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. hematological profiles including lym, ldh, crp and il-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of

nationwide traffic restrictions and stay at home movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. based on baidu migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g february 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-wuhan region (y). one is the sum travelers from wuhan during january 20 to january 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of covid-19 was confirmed and announced on january 20. the other is the seed cases from wuhan before january 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before january 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. a simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054\\\\\\\\*x1+2.3455\\\\\\\\*x2 (n = 44, r2 = 0.9330, p<10-7). even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by february 27 in non-wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and stay at home movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of covid-19 across china mainland. the strategy adopted by china has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of wuhan and experience from china. efforts of 29 provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against

and has since rapidly spread across china and to the globe. this virus shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining unclear. here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from covid-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-covid-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of covid-19 during its infection of the human body. methods: we analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation distribution in the samples of covid-19 infected patients, and compare the data with those from the pneumonia cases not caused by covid-19. the study enrolled 125 patients, comprising 103 covid-19-infected patients and 22 non-covid-19 pneumonia cases. laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. blood was collected for lymphocyte subsets and cytokines determination by flow cytometry analysis. the differences in biochemical indices and lymphocyte subsets distribution between covid-19-infected and non-covid-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes relating to organ injury in covid-19 infected patients (exclude asymptomatic infected cases). results: we observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (crp, ldh, ast, egfr and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the covid-19-infected and non-covid-19-caused pneumonia cases. correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the covid-19 infected patients. conclusions: the present study indicates significantly different clinical features between covid-19-caused and non-covid-19-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in covid-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (\\\"cytokine storm\\\").

widespread human infections across the globe. while genetically distinct from sars-cov, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (rbd) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), for virus entry. therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (s) glycoprotein of sars-cov in order to aid research on the newly emerged sars-cov-2. here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the s2 subunit of sars-cov s is highly conserved in multiple strains of sars-cov-2. consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mabs) raised against this immunogenic sars-cov fragment were able to recognise the s protein of sars-cov-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. importantly, one of them (mab 1a9) was demonstrated to detect s in sars-cov-2-infected cells. to our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mabs targeting the s2 domain of sars-cov can cross-react with sars-cov-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the s2 subunit. these cross-reactive mabs may serve as tools useful for sars-cov-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease covid-19.']\",\"['background: since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) broke out in wuhan, hubei province, china, tremendous infected cases has risen all over

modeling from data in china. matching and fitting with these scenarios, the ifp of time in south korea would be mar 6-mar 12, italy mar 10-mar 24, and iran is mar 10-mar 24. the numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in south korea, 209k in italy, and 226k in iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. there should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. in that case, the ifp will arrive earlier than our estimation. however, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. if that happens, the ifp of increment will be higher than predicted above. conclusion: we can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. with the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of covid-19. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement the reported work was supported in part by research

not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2). critically, however, and in a similar manner to hcov-19, rmyn02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike (s) protein. this provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. together, these data suggest that hcov-19 originated from multiple

effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. in this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the hcov-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. phylogenetic analyses of 15 hcov whole genomes reveal that 2019-ncov has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with sars-cov (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic hcovs. specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-ncov are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to sars-cov. using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known hcov-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of hcovs. in addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-hcov repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and hcov-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the complementary exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the hcov-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. in summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug

and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of remdesivir in \\u2172 stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. the main intervention methods include traditional chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated chinese and western medicine treatment. the subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (\\u2265 18 years old). the main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. the duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% ci: 146.3 - 328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% ci: 166.6 - 363.4 d). overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. conclusions: disorderly and intensive clinical trials of covid-19 using traditional chinese medicine and western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in china. however, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about covid-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of covid-19 in china. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### clinical trial no applicable. ### funding statement no

cities in mainland china have reported confirmed cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-ncov), but the city-level epidemical dynamics is unknown. the aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-ncov at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland china. we developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. we introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. we used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to wuhan. this city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to february 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on february 11, 2020. we used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to march 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. we estimated that the total infections in mainland china would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by march 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by february 21. this date can be advanced to february 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to february 26 under pressure of work resuming. except wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by march 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of february under three scenarios. the spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing

laid unprecedented psychological stress on health workers (hws). we aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on hws at tongji hospital in wuhan, china. methods: we conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of hws via online questionnaires between february 8th and 10th, 2020. we evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by impact of event scale-revised (ies-r), patient health questionnaire-9 (phq-9), and generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (gad-7), respectively. we also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by tongji hospital. multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. results: we received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) hws reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. women (hazard ratio[hr], 1.31; p=0.032), years of working> 10 years (hr, 2.02; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (hr, 1.51; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (hr, 3.27; p<0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (hr, 1.23; p=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [or], 0.76; p=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (or, 0.69; p=0.004)

2019, a novel coronavirus (covid-19) pneumonia hit wuhan, hubei province, china and spread to the rest of china and overseas. the emergence of this virus coincided with the spring festival travel rush in china. it is possible to estimate total number of cases of covid-19 in wuhan, by 23 january 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. methods: we built a model to estimate the total number of cases in wuhan by 23 january 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside wuhan city in china, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in wuhan. we employed population flow data from different sources between wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 january 2020. the number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. findings: from overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% ci: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% ci: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% ci: 4732, 5859) as total cases in wuhan

epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. however, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. one approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. other approaches use rate equations such as the seir and logistical models. here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. we cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease. ### competing interest statement the authors have declared no competing interest. ### funding statement no funding supported this research ### author declarations all relevant
